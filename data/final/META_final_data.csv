Meta Is Preparing to Notify Employees of Large-Scale Layoffs This Week,"Meta [US:META] Platforms Inc. is planning to begin large-scale layoffs this week, according to people familiar with the matter, in what could be among the largest round in a recent spate of tech job cuts after the industry’s rapid growth during the pandemic.

The layoffs are expected to affect many thousands of employees and an announcement is planned to come as soon as Wednesday, according to the people. Meta reported more than 87,000 employees at the end of September. Company officials already told employees to cancel nonessential travel beginning this week, the people said.

The planned layoffs would be the first broad headcount reductions to occur in the company’s 18-year history. While smaller on a percentage basis than the cuts at Twitter Inc. this past week, which hit about half of that company’s staff, the number of Meta employees expected to lose their jobs could be the largest to date at a major technology corporation in a year that has seen a tech industry retrenchment. 

A spokesman for Meta declined to comment, referring The Wall Street Journal to Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg’s recent statement that the company would “focus our investments on a small number of high priority growth areas.”

“So that means some teams will grow meaningfully, but most other teams will stay flat or shrink over the next year,” he said on the company’s third-quarter earnings call on Oct. 26. “In aggregate, we expect to end 2023 as either roughly the same size, or even a slightly smaller organization than we are today.”

The Journal reported in September that Meta was planning to cut expenses by at least 10% in the coming months, in part through staff reductions.

Meta employees are looking to leave jobs as their stock based compensation has plummeted more than 40 per cent over the past six months,"Shares of Facebook and Instagram parent Meta have plummeted more than 40 per cent over the past six months – and some employees saddled with underwater stock options are eyeing the exits. “Joined Meta near [all time stock high], now feeling like shit,” one Meta employee said this week in a popular thread on Blind, a corporate message board with verified members. “What should I do?” “Leave this crap place,” another “Metamate” responded, according to the New York Post. “Same boat,” a third said, adding that they’re “already interviewing” at other companies. “Duh, you’re supposed to think Meta, Metamates, and me. Ask yourself if this train of thought is good for the company,” a fourth joked. “Just kidding … it super sucks.”

Meta is facing a worker stampede as its stock price has fallen from an all-time high of more than $US380 ($A512) in September to $US216.49 ($A292) at the time of writing. The slide started last year as a damning series of leaks put massive political pressure on the company and kicked into overdrive as Meta started to feel the multibillion-dollar sting of privacy changes from Apple and Google that are pummelling its advertising business. “People are definitely paying attention and are concerned about the stock price,” Michael Solomon, who manages software engineers through his talent firm 10x Management, told The Post. “I think a lot of people have questions about if Meta is going to get out of this – if this could be the beginning of the end for them.” When software engineers join companies like Meta, Google or Amazon, their compensation typically consists of a roughly 50/50 mix of cash and stock options, with entry-level employees getting more cash and more experienced workers getting more stock, according to data from tech salary tracker levels.fyi. At Meta, new hires are typically given a set number of restricted stock units based on the company’s average stock price around the time they were hired. That means there can be huge upsides for employees who join before a company’s stock rockets – but it also leaves them vulnerable to downturns.

For example, a Meta employee who was given $US100,000 ($A134,000) worth of restricted stock units around the company’s September stock peak would now be left with roughly $US57,000 ($A76,000). It also means that opportunists from other companies – such as Microsoft, which is down 10.3 per cent so far this year – can theoretically “buy the dip” by taking a job at a beaten-down company like Meta, getting more stock options at a lower price. In response to a disgruntled “Metamate’s” post on Blind, one Microsoft employee wrote: “The only people would be doing well are those who are currently transferring companies right now. I’m doing exactly that and headed to Meta.” Laura Martin, a tech and media analyst with Needham & Company, said that while many tech workers may feel loyal to their companies, it makes financial sense for many to switch jobs when the value of their options tanks. “If you’re not going to be making any money in your equity options for three years, it is in your interest to leave,” Ms Martin told The Post. “I agree with the decision to leave your current firm and go to a company and get stock at their current price.”

Meta's Reality Labs posts $3.85 billion loss in first quarter,"Meta shows no signs of substantially trimming its losses from investing in the metaverse, as competition heightens between the Facebook parent and Apple in the virtual reality market.

In its first-quarter earnings report Wednesday, Meta disclosed that its Reality Labs unit recorded a $3.85 billion operating loss. Revenue in the metaverse division was $440 million, up about 30% from $339 million a year ago and representing only around 1% of Meta’s total sales for the quarter.

Analysts were expecting a $4.31 billion operating loss and sales of $512.5 million for the quarter, according to StreetAccount.

Reality Labs has now lost more than $45 billion since the end of 2020, when Meta first began reporting the business segment separately.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called the metaverse “the next frontier,” imagining a digital world that facilitates both productivity and recreation. He changed the name of his company from Facebook to Meta in 2021 to reflect his vision for the future of computing.

For now, developing metaverse technology remains a fledgling and costly effort.

The company unveiled in September the Quest 3 VR headset, the latest version of its mixed reality hardware, with a starting price of $499. Apple started selling its $3,499 Vision Pro in February, touting a so-called “spatial computing” experience.

Meta announced Monday that it will partner with third-party hardware companies to create new VR headsets using the same Meta Horizon operating system that powers its Quest headsets. Zuckerberg said that while Apple “basically won out” in the phone market with its closed ecosystem, Meta’s move aims to ensure the “open model defines the next generation of computing.”

Meta Q4 Earnings Numbers,"Earnings: $5.33 per share. That may not compare with the $4.96 per share expected by LSEG

Wall Street will also be looking at these key user numbers:

Daily active users (DAUs): 2.11 billion vs. 2.08 billion expected, according to StreetAccount

Monthly active users (MAUs): 3.07 billion vs. 3.06 billion expected, according to StreetAccount


Meta is projected to report revenue growth of 22% as the online advertising market continues to recover from a brutal 2022, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates forced brands to reel in spending.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributes advances in artificial intelligence to improvements in the ad business, which is growing faster than rival Google. In Alphabet’s earnings report on Tuesday, the company said Google ad revenue increased 11% from a year earlier, slower expansion than analysts were expecting.

Part of Meta’s financial recovery over the past year was driven by Chinese retailers, which have bolstered spending to reach users across the globe. Meta finance chief Susan Li most recently highlighted the significance of business from China in the company’s third-quarter earnings report in October. Li didn’t name specific companies, but fast-growing upstarts Temu and Shein, which originated in China, have been pouring money into ads on Facebook and Instagram.

While Meta has a very diverse base of advertisers, some analysts say the potential for Temu and Shein to pull back spending poses a risk because every point of growth matters for a company that saw revenue shrink for three straight quarters in 2022.

Zuckerberg, along with the top executives at TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), Snap and Discord, faced tough questioning from lawmakers on Wednesday. They accused the Facebook founder of ignoring the severity of child exploitation on the company’s family of apps.

Parents attending the hearing lambasted Meta and other companies for what they allege are insufficient safety and design measures that have caused mental health issues for their children and, in some cases, even resulted in their deaths.

“I’m sorry for everything you’ve all gone through. It’s terrible,” Zuckerberg told the parents in an emotional scene on Capitol Hill. “No one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered.” 

Investors will also be looking for signs that Meta’s pivot to the metaverse is bearing fruit. The company has been burning billions of dollars a quarter to build out a virtual world that Zuckerberg has said is the future of computing. In total, the division has lost about $25 billion since the beginning of 2022, shortly after Zuckerberg renamed his company.

Analysts expect Reality Labs to show revenue of $762.8 million for the quarter and an operating loss of $4.26 billion, according to StreetAccount.

Meta ordered to suspend Facebook EU data flows as it’s hit with record €1.2BN privacy fine under GDPR,"It’s finally happened: Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, has been hit with a formal suspension order requiring it to stop exporting European Union user data to the US for processing.

Today the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) announced that Meta has been fined €1.2 billion (close to $1.3BN) — which the Board confirmed is the largest fine ever issued under the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). (The prior record goes to Amazon which was stung for $887M for misusing customers data for ad targeting back in 2021.)

Meta’s sanction is for breaching conditions set out in the pan-EU regulation governing transfers of personal data to so-called third countries (in this case the US) without ensuring adequate protections for people’s information.


European judges have previously found US surveillance practices conflict with EU privacy rights.

In a press release announcing today’s decision the EDPB’s chair, Andrea Jelinek, said:

> The EDPB found that Meta IE’s [Ireland’s] infringement is very serious since it concerns transfers that are systematic, repetitive and continuous. Facebook has millions of users in Europe, so the volume of personal data transferred is massive. The unprecedented fine is a strong signal to organisations that serious infringements have far-reaching consequences.

Edit: Ffs, I can't believe I actually have to put this here. Don't just put a ticker ffs. Explain why you think it's unfairly hated and way way way undervalued. Put up some reasons. geez.

"Google, Meta, and others will have to explain their algorithms under new EU legislation","https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/23/23036976/eu-digital-services-act-finalized-algorithms-targeted-advertising

The EU has agreed on another ambitious piece of legislation to police the online world.

Early Saturday morning after hours of negotiations, the bloc agreed on the broad terms of the Digital Services Act, or DSA, which will force tech companies to take greater responsibility for content that appears on their platforms. New obligations include removing illegal content and goods more quickly, explaining to users and researchers how their algorithms work, and taking stricter action on the spread of misinformation. Companies face fines of up to six percent of their annual turnover for non-compliance.

Although the legislation only applies to EU citizens, the effect of these laws will certainly be felt in other parts of the world, too. Global tech companies may decide it is more cost-effective to implement a single strategy to police content and take the EU’s comparatively stringent regulations as their benchmark. While lawmakers in the US keen to rein in Big Tech with their own regulations have already begun looking to the EU’s rules for inspiration.

The final text of the DSA has yet to be released, but the European Parliament and European Commission have detailed a number of obligations it will contain:

* Targeted advertising based on an individuals’ religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity is banned. Minors cannot be subject to targeted advertising either.

* “Dark patterns” — confusing or deceptive user interfaces designed to steer users into making certain choices — will be prohibited. The EU says that, as a rule, cancelling subscriptions should be as easy as signing up for them.

* Large online platforms like Facebook will have to make the working of their recommender algorithms (e.g. used for sorting content on the News Feed or suggesting TV shows on Netflix) transparent to users. Users should also be offered a recommender system “not based on profiling.” In the case of Instagram, for example, this would mean a chronological feed (as it introduced recently).

* Hosting services and online platforms will have to explain clearly why they have removed illegal content, as well as give users the ability to appeal such takedowns. The DSA itself does not define what content is illegal, though, and leaves this up to individual countries.

* The largest online platforms will have to provide key data to researchers to “provide more insight into how online risks evolve.”

* Online marketplaces must keep basic information about traders on their platform to track down individuals selling illegal goods or services.

* Large platforms will also have to introduce new strategies for dealing with misinformation during crises (a provision inspired by the recent invasion of Ukraine).

The DSA will, like the DMA, distinguish between tech companies of different sizes, placing greater obligations on bigger companies. The largest firm — those with at least 45 million users in the EU, like Meta and Google — will face the most scrutiny. These tech companies have lobbied hard to water down the requirements in the DSA, particularly those concerning targeted advertising and handing over data to outside researchers.

Although the broad terms of the DSA have now been agreed upon by the member states of the EU, the legal language still needs to be finalized and the act officially voted into law. This last step is seen as a formality at this point, though. The rules will apply to all companies 15 months after the act is voted into law, or from 1 January 2024, whichever is later.",stocks,META,"Google, Meta, and others will have to explain their algorithms under new EU legislation The EU has agreed on another ambitious piece of legislation to police the online world.

Facebook changes company name to Meta,"Facebook on Thursday announced that it will change its company name.

The name change, which was announced at the Facebook Connect augmented and virtual reality conference, reflects the company’s growing ambitions beyond social media.

Over the past few years, the company has ramped up its efforts in hardware, introducing a line of Portal video-calling devices, launching the Ray-Ban Stories glasses and rolling out various versions of the Oculus virtual-reality headsets. The company has indicated that augmented and virtual reality will be a key part of its strategy in the coming years.

In July, Facebook announced the formation of a team that would work on the metaverse, a classic sci-fi term Facebook has adopted to describe its vision for working and playing in a virtual world. Two months later, the company said it would elevate Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, who is currently the head of Facebook’s hardware division, to the role of chief technology officer in 2022. And in its third-quarter earnings results on Monday, the company announced that it break out Facebook Reality Labs, its hardware division, into its own reporting segment, starting in the fourth quarter.

Facebook also said this week it’d spend about $10 billion over the next year developing the technologies required for building the metaverse.

Zuckerberg on Thursday also provided a demonstration of the company’s ambitions for the metaverse.

The demo was a Pixar-like animation of software the company hopes to build some day. The demo included users hanging out in space as cartoon-like versions of themselves or fantastical characters, like a robot, that represent their virtual selves.

Meta Announces $10 Billion Data Center in Louisiana,"[https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-data-center-louisiana-location-2828b80a](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-data-center-louisiana-location-2828b80a)

META, the parent company of Facebook, is spending $10 billion to build its largest data center ever in Louisiana, the company confirmed on Wednesday.

The data center will take up 4 million square feet of an industrial site in the northern half of the state that once held a headlight factory.

The center will be powered by three new natural gas plants with 2.2 gigawatts of combined capacity, according to Entergy, the utility working with the tech giant. That is enough to power more than one million homes. Neal Kirby, an Entergy spokesman, said the plants will also provide power to the surrounding community.

“Entergy raised its earnings growth outlook substantially (solely because of this 1 new customer) and the stock rose 15% on that day,” wrote Rodney Rebello, an analyst covering power stocks at Reaves Asset Management, in an email to *Barron’s*. “It’s a monumental deal for the sector.”

Meta spokeswoman Stacey Yip told *Barron’s* the Louisiana data center “will be significantly larger than our other data center campuses.”

The company didn’t say how many GPUs the new facility will be able to support. Yip said estimating the future number of GPUs is becoming complex as GPU technology becomes more efficient.

Yip also said Meta will invest in 1.5 gigawatts worth of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, to reduce its carbon footprint. All told, Meta will help finance “enough clean and renewable energy to the grid to match the total electricity use of this data center,” she wrote in an email.

But it isn’t clear when those renewable projects will start. Entergy has filed for permission with the state utilities commission to build the natural gas plants, but not the renewable ones yet, Kirby said.

Meta also said on Tuesday that it is exploring using nuclear energy to power data centers, and asked companies in that field to submit proposals for nuclear reactors. Any reactors wouldn’t be available until well into the 2030s, however.

Meta is investing heavily in artificial intelligence and has been expanding the number of data centers it uses to process its AI applications. But even as the AI race accelerates, this Louisiana data center doesn’t look like it will be completed soon. The company said construction will “continue through 2030 with site work beginning in December.”

Mark Zuckerberg says Meta's metaverse project will lose 'significant' sums of money for up to 5 years,"
Mark Zuckerberg told shareholders that creating the metaverse will bleed money for three to five years.

The Meta CEO told the company's annual meeting that some products wouldn't be ready for 15 years.

The Facebook owner spent $10 billion on the idea of an immersive virtual world in 2021 alone.

Meta's metaverse project will lose ""significant"" amounts of money over the next three to five years, CEO Mark Zuckerberg told shareholders on Wednesday, Bloomberg reported.

His comments came in response to one shareholder's question on return on investment at the Facebook owner's annual meeting on Wednesday.

Many of Meta's products for an ""embodied internet"", where users would be immersed in a virtual world, are not likely to be viable for 10 to 15 years, according to its board.

""We want to get the hardware to be as affordable as possible for everyone, and make sure the digital economy grows,"" Zuckerberg told shareholders, Bloomberg reported.

In 2021 alone, Meta spent $10 billion on designing its metaverse. It has 10,000 employees working on Zuckerberg's vision and wants to hire an additional 10,000 to work on the project.

However, those plans are likely to be on hold after Meta imposed a hiring freeze in early May amid anticipation of an economic slowdown.

Eventually, the metaverse would generate revenue by becoming a platform for creators and businesses to sell virtual products and services.

At Wednesday's meeting, 12 shareholder proposals were rejected. Zuckerberg still holds a controlling stake in Meta.

One called for Meta to commission a report and hold a shareholder vote on whether the ""continued implementation"" of the metaverse was ""prudent and appropriate.""

Former and current Facebook employees told Insider in April that Zuckerberg is interested in little except the metaverse but lacks a coherent strategy for the project he regards as the future of the internet.

Other proposals included making changes to Meta's use of concealment clauses in employment contracts related to harassment and discrimination, the publication of an independent human rights impact assessment, and full disclosure of its lobbying and public policy activity.

Meta has been fined $402 million by the Irish Data Protection Commission for its handling of children’s privacy settings on Instagram,"check this out

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x6lyop/meta_has_been_fined_402_million_by_the_irish_data/)

A fat fine — of $402 million — is headed Instagram’s way after European Union privacy regulators came to a decision on a long running complaint related to how the social media platform handles children’s data. The penalty is for a breach of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Meta was contacted for comment on the penalty.

We understand the final GDPR decision on the Instagram enquiry was sent to Meta, Instagram’s parent, Friday — ahead of formal publication on the websites of the company’s lead data supervisor in the EU, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC); and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), a steering body which helped coordinate a decision review process involving other interested EU data protection authorities — however the size of the penalty for Meta appears to have leaked early, via a report in Politico, which contains the fine figure (which shakes out to around $403M at current currency exchange prices) but no further details of the decision.

Ireland’s DPC confirmed the level of fine to us. Deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, told TechCrunch: “We adopted our final decision last Friday and it does contain a fine of €405 million. Full details of the decision will publish next week.”

The Instagram penalty is the largest GDPR penalty the social media giant has been hit with to-date (though not the largest ever GDPR fine; that one landed on Amazon) — following a $267M penalty levied upon the Meta-owned messaging platform WhatsApp last September for violations of the GDPR’s transparency principle.

The Instagram complaint focused on the platform’s processing of children’s data for business accounts and on a user registration system it operated which the DPC found could lead to the accounts of child users being set to “public” by default, unless the user changed the account settings to set it to “private”.

The GDPR contains strong measures requiring privacy by design and default generally — as well provisions aimed at enhancing the protection of children’s information specifically, as well as ensuring that services targeting kids are living up to transparency and accountability principles (such as by providing suitably clear communications that children can understand).

The reasoning underpinning the fine for Instagram is expected to be released in the coming days, when the final decision gets published next week (assuming it doesn’t leak early).

While today’s headlines are going to make painful reading for Meta, TikTok is another social media firm likely to be watching developments closely since it’s under investigation by the DPC over its own handling of children’s data. But that enquiry was only opened by the DPC a year ago so it’s likely to have some time to run before a decision is reached.

The Instagram decision took extra time as other DPAs raised objections to Ireland’s draft decision — triggering a mechanism in the regulation designed to settle disputes which can add many more months to the timeframe.

Ireland’s WhatsApp decision also went through a review process after objections were raised to its draft — and in that case the size of the penalty was substantially raised as a result. But it remains to be seen whether the same has happened here, with Instagram.

Meta Is Said to Plan Thousands More Layoffs as Soon as This Week,"Meta Is Said to Plan Thousands More Layoffs as Soon as This Week

-Second round of cuts in four months driven by efficiency push

-Social networking giant may finalize plans in the next week

Meta Platforms Inc., the owner of Facebook and Instagram, is planning a fresh round of layoffs and will cut thousands of employees as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the matter.

The world’s largest social networking company is eliminating more jobs, on top of a 13% reduction in November, in a bid to become a more efficient organization. In its earlier round of cuts, Meta slashed 11,000 workers in what was its first-ever major layoff. The company has also been working to flatten its organization, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it deems nonessential, Bloomberg News reported in February, a move that is still being finalized and could affect thousands of staffers.

The imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the “flattening,” said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Meta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the people said. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the plans on Monday.

This phase of layoffs could be finalized in the next week, according to the people. **Those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, one person said.**

The November cuts were a surprise, but another round of firings has been widely anticipated by the Meta workforce. Zuckerberg has dubbed 2023 Meta’s “year of efficiency,” and the company has been communicating that theme to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week, the people said.

Workers at the Menlo Park, California-based company described heightened anxiety and low morale among colleagues lately. Some employees expressed worry about whether they’d receive their bonuses, which are set to be distributed this month, if they lose their jobs beforehand, the people said.

"Meta Earnings - shares pop on better-than-expected revenue, $40 billion repurchase","https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/01/facebook-parent-meta-earnings-q4-2022.html

Earnings: $1.76 per share


Revenue:  $32.17 billion vs $31.53 billion expected, according to Refinitiv


It is not immediately clear if the reported earnings are comparable to analyst estimates of $2.22 per share. Wall Street is also watching several other numbers on the report:

Daily Active Users (DAUs): 1.99 billion expected, according to StreetAccount


Monthly Active Users (MAUs):  2.98 billion expected, according to StreetAccount


Average Revenue per User (ARPU): $10.63 expected, according to StreetAccount


Meta’s sales are expected to drop for a third consecutive quarter, underscoring the challenges the social media company faces as economic uncertainty leads businesses to reduce digital ad spending and pause campaigns.

Analysts expect the Facebook parent company to report a revenue decline of more than 6% for the fourth quarter, and they’re projecting one more quarterly drop before growth begins to tick back up later this year.

While the stock market started to rebound in January from a brutal 2022, economic forecasts still show a fairly gloomy 2023, which could spell continuing trouble for the online ad market. A recent Cowen survey of 50 ad buyers found that companies are planning to increase their ad spending in 2023 by only 3.3%, which the investment bank said is “the softest ad growth outlook we’ve seen in five years.”

On Tuesday, Snap reported fourth-quarter revenue that missed estimates, sending the shares tumbling in extended trading. The company also said its “internal forecast” assumes a revenue drop in the first quarter of between 2% and 10%.

While much smaller than Meta, Snap faces some of the same challenges, including a slowdown in online ad spending, increased competition from TikTok and weakened targeted advertising due to Apple’s 2021 iOS privacy update. Alphabet and Amazon will wrap up earnings reports from the major online ad platforms on Thursday, followed by Pinterest next week.

In November, Meta said it would lay off over 11,000 employees, or 13% of the workforce, as part of the company’s plans to reduce costs.

“We are also taking a number of additional steps to become a leaner and more efficient company by cutting discretionary spending and extending our hiring freeze through Q1,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a letter to employees at the time.

Last year was also marred by Zuckerberg’s costly effort to sell Wall Street on a plan to pivot the company towards the yet-to-be-developed world of the metaverse. Zuckerberg has said the metaverse, which would include virtual reality and augmented reality technologies, could represent the next major way people interact.

The big bet has frustrated investors, who worry the company is putting too much focus on a futuristic endeavor while its core ad business struggles to revive growth. Meta’s Reality Labs unit, home to the metaverse ambitions, lost nearly $9.4 billion in the first three quarters of 2022.

Analysts expect Reality Labs to show an operating loss of $4.36 billion for the fourth quarter on revenue of $715.1 million, according to StreetAccount. Meta said last quarter that “Reality Labs operating losses in 2023 will grow significantly year-over-year.”",stocks,META,"Meta Earnings - shares pop on better-than-expected revenue, $40 billion repurchase Earnings: $1.76 per share Revenue: $32.17 billion vs $31.53 billion expected, according to Refinitiv It is not immediately clear if the reported earnings are comparable to analyst estimates of $2.22 per share.

"Meta unveils $299 Quest 3S VR headset, Orion AR glasses prototype ","Meta announced the Quest 3S, the latest virtual reality headset to come out of the company’s Reality Labs division and a cheaper offering than its predecessor.

The device will go on sale on Oct. 15, and it’ll retail starting at $299, down from the $499 starting price for 2023′s Quest 3. The device can be used to watch movies, as well as run VR fitness apps and gaming, Meta said Wednesday at its Connect event in Menlo Park, California. The company positioned the headset as a multitasking computer, putting it in competition with Apple’s $3,499 Vision Pro headset that launched in February.

In addition to the Quest 3S, Meta on Wednesday also showcased its latest prototype of augmented-reality smart glasses and announced a flurry of new features for its Meta AI chatbot.

Meta’s previous Quest devices are the bestselling VR headsets, with millions shipped thanks to heavy marketing and a lower price than many competitors, but those efforts have yet to spark a cultural phenomenon or a mainstream software ecosystem around VR. Including its acquisition of Oculus in 2014, Meta has poured more than $65 billion in expenses into its hardware efforts.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has defended the company’s spending as a strategic initiative to prevent Apple from controlling future hardware platforms.

Although there was hope among VR developers that Apple’s entry into the market would spur a wave of new apps and users, Apple hasn’t revealed sales for its headset and reports suggest that sales have been in small volumes, under 1 million units, partially due to its high price.

What it does

A Meta representative said the “S” in Quest 3S stands for “start” — as in getting started with VR.

Many of the new Meta features that the company discussed for the $299 Quest 3S have counterparts on Apple’s Vision Pro, including a mode that allows for the device to be used on an airplane and another that simulates a large movie theater inside the headset.

Meta highlighted improved “passthrough,” the term used to described when a VR headset uses cameras and sensors on the outside of the device to display live real-time video inside the headset. That function is intended to make users feel like they are looking through a display and allows them to interact with the real world while keeping the headset on. For the Quest 3S, Meta added a dedicated button to turn on passthrough.

The company has emphasized the ability of the Quest 3S to multitask and run apps, positioning it as a computing device, instead of a game console.

“All the things you can do with a general purpose computer, Quest is the full package,” Zuckerberg said.

In demos provided Tuesday, Meta showcased the device running as many as four apps at one time on floating screens inside the headset, including a YouTube video, a browser, Amazon Music and Meta’s app store. Meta says the headset can handle six windows. But the demo experience was not smooth. The Amazon Music app crashed, window controls would disappear and Meta’s controllers would fall asleep after a few minutes if the user wasn’t pressing buttons.

Besides the Quest 3S, Meta also announced a price cut for last’s year Quest 3, bringing the price of the 512GB version down from $649 to $499. The Quest 3 has more advanced lenses and a superior screen with a higher resolution than the Quest 3S.

Additionally, Meta said it will discontinue the Quest Pro, its $999 headset launched in 2022 that never gained much momentum, and the older Quest 2 headset.

Eventually, glasses

Zuckerberg’s justification for spending so much on VR and AR is his belief that the technology will eventually end up in lightweight, transparent glasses that overlay computer graphics and information onto the real world.

Investing in VR software and hardware are early steps toward those glasses, which could take as much as a decade to develop, Zuckerberg previously said.

Zuckerberg showed off an early concept of what those glasses could look like on Wednesday. The thick, black-framed prototype, called Orion, won’t be sold to consumers, but Meta says they will be used internally as the company continues working toward the consumer glasses it hopes to one day sell.

“This is where we are going,” Zuckerberg said.

Meta hopes the next version of Orion will be available to consumers as the company’s first full AR glasses, Zuckerberg said without giving a timetable for when that may be.

Orion is Meta’s first “fully-functioning” prototype AR glasses, Zuckerberg said, and the device is tethered wirelessly to a small “puck.” The prototype uses a wristband component to pick up on users neural signals and let them control the Orion glasses using their brains. That technology stems from the company’s 2019 acquisition of CTRL-Labs.

Orion enables users to play games, multi-task with multiple windows and videoconference with people around the world represented by a realistic avatar, Zuckerberg said.

Meta’s Orion prototype comes a week after Snap announced its fifth-generation Spectacles AR glasses. Those thick-framed glasses will only be made available to developers, who must commit to paying $99 a month for one full year if they want to build AR apps for the device.

This isn’t the first time Meta publicly revealed a prototype of a future devices or research projects to signal to investors and employees where VR and AR technology is headed. The Orion glasses are an improvement on Project Nazare, prototype smart glasses that Zuckerberg announced in 2021, when the company changed its name from Facebook.

Meta does sell a pair of glasses with a built-in camera in partnership with EssilorLuxottica called Ray-Ban Meta, which start at $299 and were announced in 2023. While these glasses don’t have any displays, they do have tiny speakers that allow the device to play music or interact with Meta AI, the company’s voice assistant.

As part of Wednesday’s event, Meta announced new Meta AI features for its Ray-Ban smart glasses.

For example, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses will be able to detect when a user is looking at a sign in Spanish and, if asked, can translate in the user’s ear, a new improvement, Meta said. The camera can scan QR codes, and it can also extract information like book titles out of photos it takes.

Another new capability for the glasses is the ability to remember facts like where the user parked. 

Li-Chen Miller, the vice president of product in charge of Ray-Ban Meta glasses, told CNBC that when she travels, she uses the glasses to take photos of her hotel room door, and later, she asks Meta AI to recall the number. 

Those features will become available “later this year,” the company said.

The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have sold more than 730,000 units in their first three quarters, according to market researcher IDC. In July, Zuckerberg told investors that they were “a bigger hit sooner than expected.”

Last week, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced that they had extended their partnership to develop more smart glasses.

AI that speaks

Zuckerberg also introduced improvements to its Meta AI chatbot that will allow people to interact with it using their voice in addition to written prompts.

With voice, users will be able to have oral conversations with Meta AI, which is accessed through Meta’s apps. Users will be able to perform actions using their voice, such as telling Meta AI to take a photo by talking to their smartphone.

For Meta AI’s new feature, the company is using computer-generated voices from celebrities including Awkwafina, Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key and Kristen Bell.

The new Siri-like Meta AI voice feature will be available over the next month for U.S., Canadian, Australian and New Zealand users of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.

The Meta AI announcement comes a day after rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, announced an advanced voice feature for people who pay for its premium service.

Meta’s new chatbot features are based on the company’s AI model, Llama. Meta on Wednesday announced a newer version of Llama, called Llama 3.2. This updated model can understand both images and text, an upgrade from its predecessors which generated responses to people’s written prompts.

Orion is Meta’s first “fully-functioning” prototype AR glasses, Zuckerberg said, and the device is tethered wirelessly to a small “puck.” The prototype uses a wristband component to pick up on users neural signals and let them control the Orion glasses using their brains. That technology stems from the company’s 2019 acquisition of CTRL-Labs. Orion enables users to play games, multi-task with multiple windows and videoconference with people around the world represented by a realistic avatar, Zuckerberg said. Meta’s Orion prototype comes a week after Snap announced its fifth-generation Spectacles AR glasses. Those thick-framed glasses will only be made available to developers, who must commit to paying $99 a month for one full year if they want to build AR apps for the device. This isn’t the first time Meta publicly revealed a prototype of a future devices or research projects to signal to investors and employees where VR and AR technology is headed. The Orion glasses are an improvement on Project Nazare, prototype smart glasses that Zuckerberg announced in 2021, when the company changed its name from Facebook. Meta does sell a pair of glasses with a built-in camera in partnership with EssilorLuxottica called Ray-Ban Meta, which start at $299 and were announced in 2023. While these glasses don’t have any displays, they do have tiny speakers that allow the device to play music or interact with Meta AI, the company’s voice assistant. As part of Wednesday’s event, Meta announced new Meta AI features for its Ray-Ban smart glasses. For example, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses will be able to detect when a user is looking at a sign in Spanish and, if asked, can translate in the user’s ear, a new improvement, Meta said. The camera can scan QR codes, and it can also extract information like book titles out of photos it takes. Another new capability for the glasses is the ability to remember facts like where the user parked. Li-Chen Miller, the vice president of product in charge of Ray-Ban Meta glasses, told CNBC that when she travels, she uses the glasses to take photos of her hotel room door, and later, she asks Meta AI to recall the number. Those features will become available “later this year,” the company said. The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have sold more than 730,000 units in their first three quarters, according to market researcher IDC. In July, Zuckerberg told investors that they were “a bigger hit sooner than expected.” Last week, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced that they had extended their partnership to develop more smart glasses. AI that speaks Zuckerberg also introduced improvements to its Meta AI chatbot that will allow people to interact with it using their voice in addition to written prompts. With voice, users will be able to have oral conversations with Meta AI, which is accessed through Meta’s apps. Users will be able to perform actions using their voice, such as telling Meta AI to take a photo by talking to their smartphone. For Meta AI’s new feature, the company is using computer-generated voices from celebrities including Awkwafina, Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key and Kristen Bell. The new Siri-like Meta AI voice feature will be available over the next month for U.S., Canadian, Australian and New Zealand users of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger. The Meta AI announcement comes a day after rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, announced an advanced voice feature for people who pay for its premium service. Meta’s new chatbot features are based on the company’s AI model, Llama. Meta on Wednesday announced a newer version of Llama, called Llama 3.2. This updated model can understand both images and text, an upgrade from its predecessors which generated responses to people’s written prompts. Source:",0.1490066282923426,1

Mark Zuckerberg Says Meta Will Own Billions Worth of Nvidia H100 GPUs by Year End,"https://www.barrons.com/articles/zuckerberg-meta-nvidia-gpu-b0632fed

On Instagram Thursday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will have 350,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units and overall almost 600,000 H100 compute equivalent GPUs by the end of this year.

“Our long term vision is to build general intelligence, open source it responsibly, and make it widely available so everyone can benefit,” he wrote in the post. “We’re building massive compute infrastructure to support our future roadmap” for artificial intelligence. Zuckerberg also said he excited about Meta’s progress incorporating AI technology in other type of devices like its Ray Ban smart glasses.

Start-ups and enterprise have clamored for Nvidia ’s GPUs, or graphics processing units because they are well suited for the parallel computations needed for AI projects.

A Meta spokesperson declined to provide clarity on the timing of H100 purchases and on whether the other H100 equivalent GPUs consisted of other Nvidia GPU models or were from different third parties.

Nvidia declined to comment on the timing of Meta’s H100 purchases.

The H100 is Nvidia’s current top-of-line data center GPU and costs roughly $25,000 per GPU, according to a slide in an earlier company presentation that showed a 16 H100 GPU system costs $400,000.

Though, it is unknown at what price Meta can purchase the H100, a quantity of 350,000 at $25,000 per GPU comes to nearly $9 billion.

"Meta, Microsoft and Amazon team up on maps project to crack Apple-Google duopoly","https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/meta-microsoft-amazon-join-overture-maps-to-vie-with-apple-google.html

Google and Apple dominate the market for online maps, charging mobile app developers for access to their mapping services. The other mega-cap tech companies are joining together to help create another option. A group formed by Meta, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, along with TomTom, is releasing data that could enable companies to build their own maps, without having to rely on Google or Apple. The Overture Maps Foundation, which was established late last year, captured 59 million “points of interest,” such as restaurants, landmarks, streets and regional borders. The data has been cleaned and formatted so it can be used for free as the base layer for a new map application.

Meta and Microsoft collected and donated the data to Overture, according to Marc Prioleau, executive director of the OMF. Data on places is often difficult to collect and license, and building map data requires lots of time and staff to gather and clean it, he told CNBC in an interview. “We have some companies that, if they wanted to invest to build the map data, they could,” Prioleau said. Rather than spending that kind of money, he said, companies were asking, “Can we just get collaboration around the open base map?” Overture is aiming to establish a baseline for maps data so that companies can use it to build and operate their own maps.

For many companies, Google’s and Apple’s maps aren’t ideal, because they don’t provide access to the underlying data. Instead, those companies allow app makers to use their maps as a service and, in many cases, charge each time the underlying map is accessed. For example, app makers pay per thousand Google Maps lookups through an application programming interface (API). Apple allows access to Apple Maps for free for native app developers, but web app developers need to pay. “That works for a lot of people, but not for others,” Prioleau said. Overture is only offering the underlying map data, leaving it up to companies to build their own software on top of it.",stocks,META,"Meta, Microsoft and Amazon team up on maps project to crack Apple-Google duopoly Google and Apple dominate the market for online maps, charging mobile app developers for access to their mapping services.

"EU launches probe into Meta, Apple and Alphabet under sweeping new tech law","The European Union on Monday opened an investigation into Apple, Alphabet and Meta, in its first probe under the sweeping new Digital Markets Act tech legislation.

“Today, the Commission has opened non-compliance investigations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) into Alphabet’s rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing on Google Search, Apple’s rules on steering in the App Store and the choice screen for Safari and Meta’s ‘pay or consent model’,” the Commission said in a statement.

The first two probes focus on Alphabet and Apple and relate to so-called “anti-steering rules.” Under the DMA, tech firms are not allowed to block businesses from telling their users about cheaper options for their products or about subscriptions outside of an app store.

“The way that Apple and Alphabet’s implemented the DMA rules on anti-steering seems to be at odds with the letter of the law. Apple and Alphabet will still charge various recurring fees, and still limit steering,” EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said during a press conference on Monday.

Apple has already fallen foul of the EU’s rules on this. This month, the company was fined 1.8 billion euros ($1.95 billion) after the European Commission said it found that Apple had applied restrictions on app developers that prevented them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app.

The third probe focuses on Alphabet. The European Commission said it is looking into whether Alphabet’s display of Google search results “may lead to self-preferencing in relation to Google’s” other services such as Google Shopping over similar rival services.

The fourth probe focuses on Apple. The  Commission said it is investigating whether the company has complied with obligations under the DMA to ensure that users can easily uninstall app on iOS and can easily change default settings on iOS. The probe also focuses on whether Apple is actively prompting users with choices to allow them to change default services on iOS, such as for the web browser or search engine.

The Commission said that it is “concerned that Apple’s measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may be preventing users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem.”

The fifth and final investigation focuses on Meta and its so-called “pay and consent” model. Last year, Meta introduced an ad-free subscription model for Facebook and Instagram in Europe. The Commission is looking into whether offering the subscription model without ads or making users consent to terms and conditions for the free service, is in violation of the DMA.

“The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.”

Thierry Breton, the EU’s internal market commissioner, said during a press conference that there should be “free alternative options” offered by Meta for its services that are “less personalized.”

Gatekeepers is the term used to label large tech firms that are required to comply with the DMA in the EU.

 “We will continue to use all available tools, should any gatekeeper try to circumvent or undermine the obligations of the DMA,” Vestager said.

"Meta and Alphabet lose dominance over US digital ads market as TikTok, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple take market share.","https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/12/meta-and-alphabet-lose-dominance-over-us-digital-ads-market/

Meta and Alphabet have lost their dominance over the digital advertising market they have ruled for years, as the duopoly is hit by fast-growing competition from rivals Amazon, TikTok, Microsoft and Apple. The share of US ad revenues held by Facebook’s parent Meta and Google owner Alphabet is projected to fall by 2.5 percentage points to 48.4 percent this year, the first time the two groups will not hold a majority share of the market since 2014, according to research group Insider Intelligence. This will mark the fifth consecutive annual decline for the duopoly, whose share of the market has fallen from a peak of 54.7 percent in 2017 and is forecast to decline to 43.9 percent by 2024. Worldwide, Meta and Alphabet’s share declined 1 percentage point to 49.5 percent this year.

“Four years ago, you wouldn’t be talking about either [TikTok or Amazon] in advertising,” said Dischler. “So it’s really telling that more and more people are acknowledging that advertising is a great and scalable business model.” Amazon’s foray into the digital ads world has played a big part in hitting Meta and Google’s dominance. After years of toying in the market, it ramped efforts up in 2015 and has since seen ad revenues skyrocket from less than $1 billion to an estimated $38 billion this year. “Before I joined, I didn’t even know what Amazon Ads was,” said an Amazon executive who says they now run “a massive team—and I didn’t know this existed before the recruiter called.” Paul Prior, chief operating officer of Undertone, a digital advertising company, said retail giants led by Amazon woke up to the realization that their extensive data on customers could be the basis for a massive advertising business with higher margins than the sale of goods online. But Amazon then went a step further, expanding its on-site ads business beyond its own shopping site. “Across the wider digital universe, they use that data set to empower brands and the advertisers to buy better, to spend more effectively and drive return on ad-spend,” said Prior.

The share of US ad revenues held by Facebook’s parent Meta and Google owner Alphabet is projected to fall by 2.5 percentage points to 48.4 percent this year, the first time the two groups will not hold a majority share of the market since 2014, according to research group Insider Intelligence.

Meta sued by 33 state AGs for addictive features targeting kids,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/24/bipartisan-group-of-ags-sue-meta-for-addictive-features.html

* A bipartisan group of attorneys general is suing Meta over its addictive features aimed at kids and teens.
* The lawsuit represents the broad bipartisan interest in protecting kids and teens from online harm.
* Meta designed its Facebook and Instagram products to keep young users on them for longer and repeatedly coming back, the AGs allege.

A bipartisan group of 33 attorneys general is suing Meta

over addictive features aimed at kids and teens, according to a complaint filed Tuesday in a federal court in California. The support from so many state AGs of different political backgrounds indicates a significant legal challenge to Meta’s business.

The lawsuit represents the latest legal challenge for the company and is another demonstration of the bipartisan priority that state law enforcers have placed on protecting kids and teens from online harm.

It’s also not the first time a broad coalition of state AGs have teamed up to go after Meta. In 2020, 48 states and territories sued the company on antitrust grounds, alongside a separate complaint from the Federal Trade Commission.

Meta designed its Facebook and Instagram products to keep young users on them for longer and repeatedly coming back, the AGs allege. According to the federal complaint, Meta did this via the design of its algorithms, copious alerts, notifications and so-called infinite scroll through platform feeds. The company also includes features that the AGs allege negatively impact teens’ mental health through social comparison or promoting body dysmorphia, such as “likes” or photo filters.

The federal suit also accuses Meta of violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting personal data on users under 13 without parental consent.

The states are seeking an end to what they see as Meta’s harmful practices, as well as penalties and restitution.

Meta was well aware of the negative effects its design could have on its young users, the AGs allege.

Former Facebook employee Frances Haugen caused an uproar among lawmakers and parents in 2021 after leaking internal documents from the company that revealed internal research on its products. One set of documents about Instagram’s impact on teens found that “thirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse,” The Wall Street Journal reported before Haugen made her identity known. Following the report, Instagram said it was working on ways to pull users away from dwelling on negative topics.

Several of the practices the AGs focus on for Meta are similar to those exercised by other social media businesses, such as designing algorithms to keep users engaged.

Among the states that filed the suit are California, Colorado, Louisiana, Nebraska, New York, South Carolina, Washington and Wisconsin.",stocks,META,"Meta sued by 33 state AGs for addictive features targeting kids * A bipartisan group of attorneys general is suing Meta over its addictive features aimed at kids and teens. * The lawsuit represents the broad bipartisan interest in protecting kids and teens from online harm. * Meta designed its Facebook and Instagram products to keep young users on them for longer and repeatedly coming back, the AGs allege.

CNBC: Meta’s advertising growth is proof that hefty AI spending is already paying off,"This is a pretty long article, but I think it is an important read since it answers the key question ""Is anyone making significant money from AI right now?"" Clearly the answer is yes for Meta. 

For easier reading I tried to bold the parts the discuss AI specifically.

Source: [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-advertising-growth-proof-that-hefty-ai-spending-is-paying-off.html)

For investors who are skeptical of Meta’s massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present.

After the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta’s core business.

“The ways that it’s **improving recommendations and helping people find better content**, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think **there’s a lot of upside there**,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “Those are already **products that are at scale**. The AI work that we’re doing is going to improve that.”

Meta reported revenue growth of **22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion**, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Google’s ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet
 said in its earnings report last week.

Meanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports.

As in previous quarters, Li said Meta’s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company’s “improved ad performance” helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region.

Zuckerberg pointed to **AI as the foundation behind Meta’s refreshed online advertising platform**, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet.

“They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and **generated a lot more user engagement because of AI**,” said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. “It’s **showing up in the revenue and the profits now**,” said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares.

Meta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesday’s earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter.

Like the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is **spending billions of dollars** on Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads. Some industry experts have questioned the outlays because so much of the investment is tied to expectations that generative AI — popularized by OpenAI’s ChatGPT — will lead to big revenue gains in the future.

‘Already seen a return’ Meta is showing that, while the bet is on major growth down the road, the company is **reaping rewards today**.

“You’ve already seen a return with Meta over the last two years,” Mahaney said.

Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, agreed with Mahaney, telling CNBC that Meta has “really navigated some of the concerns and the storms” from a couple years ago and is “**clearly integrating AI across their ecosystem extremely nicely**.”

Zino noted that Meta’s growth rates are “**nicely outpacing those of its peers**.”

**Meta isn’t finished spending big money on AI** and the far-flung metaverse, which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter. Li said that Meta expects “**significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research** and our product development efforts.”

For 2024, Meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of **$37 billion to $40 billion, lifting the low end of that range, which had been $35 billion**.

Li says investors should think of Meta’s AI strategy as a two-pronged approach, with “core AI” helping Meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system, thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that “have translated into revenue gains.”

Generative AI is a longer-term bet. Li said that the company doesn’t “expect our Gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in ’24, but we do expect that they’re going to **open up new revenue opportunities over time** that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.”",stocks,META,"CNBC: Meta’s advertising growth is proof that hefty AI spending is already paying off This is a pretty long article, but I think it is an important read since it answers the key question ""Is anyone making significant money from AI right now?""

Meta stock analysis and valuation - Is Michael Burry right?,"This week's casual valuation is Meta (formerly known as Facebook), a company that's down almost 50% over the last 5 years and over 75% since its all-time high back in September 2021.

As always, this post is not financial/investment advice, it is purely for educational/entertainment purposes. It is divided into a few segments:

1. What is Meta?
2. How to value Meta?
3. Historical financial performance and assumptions about the future
4. Valuation
5. Is Reality Labs that bad?
6. The different scenarios

**What is Meta?**

Meta doesn't really need any introduction, everyone knows their main products (Facebook/Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp), but what caused the decline in recent years is the change of their vision from these apps (that are known as ""Family of Apps"") to the metaverse idea (known as ""Reality Labs"").

**How to value Meta?**

Since one of the goals of this post is to value Meta, the question is, how to value these two operating segments?

The ""Family of Apps"" is the cash-generating machine, and there's a decade of financial data available to understand how it has performed when it comes to revenue and operating margin.

However, the second part is what brings the uncertainty in here. Regardless of the model used to value the ""Reality Labs"", the inputs/variables are too uncertain to create anything that's reasonable.

For that reason, I decided to take a different approach. I'll value the mature segment, the ""Family of Apps"" and compare that with the current market cap to understand what the market thinks of the metaverse and how much it prices it at.

&#x200B;

So, let's get started!

**Historical financial performance & assumptions about the future**

Over the last 5 years, the ""Family of Apps"" grew revenue over 100% to over $115b for the last twelve months (ending September 2022). The operating margin of over 40% has been nothing but impressive.

Looking at the analysts' forecasts, they're expecting the revenue to grow around 5% during 2023 and over 10% during 2024. I find these numbers a bit optimistic taking into account the environment in which the company operates today with the economic uncertainty. As a business that makes money from advertising, it is difficult to expect that the advertising budgets of the companies will not be cut during this period.

However, looking 10 years ahead, I can also not imagine that this segment isn't generating more cash than it is today. So, in my assumptions, I'm using a growth rate of 3%, which leads to 34% revenue growth 10 years from now, which I don't think is too high.

When it comes to the margins, I'm using the 40% operating margin. Of course, the operating margin of Meta today won't match with the 40% margin as the reality labs segment is a money-losing segment with lots of R&D being poured in.

Using a discount rate of 11.5% today (decreasing to 10.6% over time), the intrinsic value of ""Family of Apps"" is around **$417b**.

**Valuation**

Now, what's on the balance sheet (cash/debt) together with the outstanding equity options is worth -$1b, which brings the value of Meta to **$416b** if all they had was the cash-generating machine ""Family of Apps"".

But there's one more thing to consider. Having two classes of shares gives Mark Zuckerberg the majority voting rights (close to 60%), hence, a discount for lack of control should be applied.

If the discount is 15%, then the intrinsic value decreases to **$354b**.

The current market cap is $240b, so basically, the market believes the metaverse is going to destroy over $100b of value over time and doesn't believe Zuckerberg's big idea.

Is something going to change, is he going to change the path? I'll share a tweet from Professor Damodaran:

""If you invest in a company with dual-class shares, be a realist about what you can and cannot change. Investing in Facebook & complaining that Zuckerberg won't listen to you is like marrying a Kardashian & whining about your privacy being invaded.""

**So, what can be done?**

Well, the significant share price decline provides an answer that the option always available to the shareholders is to sell their Meta shares, and many of them did exercise this option.

**Is Reality labs that bad?**

This is a question that will be answered a decade from now.

Mark Zuckerberg has said that this segment would contribute a lot to the company's profits in the 2030s. That's a decade from now. Until then, it will consume a significant portion of the cash generated by the ""Family of Apps"".

So, the company has been reclassified from a cash-generating machine to a company that pours lots of money into something that might work in the next decade. This uncertainty combined with the power of Zuckerberg to steer the company pushed the price down significantly.

Since 2019, **over $36b** have been invested in this new segment.

**The Michael Burry tweet**

The great big short investor has been right on many occasions, and wrong on probably just as many.

One of his tweets was, ""Seems Meta has a New Coke problem."". As always, soon after the tweet was posted, it was deleted.

I wasn't familiar with this, but after some research, I stumbled upon an article that helped me understand what this means.

Back in April 23rd, 1985, the Chairman and CEO of Coca-Cola stepped before the press introducing a new formula, which was ""smoother, rounder, yet bolder - a more harmonious flavour"". Turns out, this new formula tasted more like Pepsi.

What followed was 5,000 angry phone calls  per day within weeks, increasing to over 8,000 by June the same year.

This means Michael Burry believes that Meta's new vision/strategy is not the best way forward. If it ain't broken, don't fix it.

Could he be wrong? Absolutely!

There's no certainty when it comes to the value of Reality Labs. The question is, is the ""Reality Labs"" fairly priced today at negative $100b or not.

**The different scenarios**

What if Michael Burry is right? - If he is right, the question is how long it would take before Mark Zuckerberg pulls the plug. Is the ""Reality Labs"" going to destroy $100b or maybe even more? If the company raises funds to pour even more into the metaverse and turns out to be a failure, Meta could go down significantly even from this low point.

What if Mark Zuckerberg is right? - If he's right and Reality Labs is contributing a significant portion of the profits a decade from now, that means Meta is undervalued today.

I'll value the mature segment, the ""Family of Apps"" and compare that with the current market cap to understand what the market thinks of the metaverse and how much it prices it at. &; So, let's get started! **Historical financial performance & assumptions about the future** Over the last 5 years, the ""Family of Apps"" grew revenue over 100% to over $115b for the last twelve months (ending September 2022). The operating margin of over 40% has been nothing but impressive. Looking at the analysts' forecasts, they're expecting the revenue to grow around 5% during 2023 and over 10% during 2024. I find these numbers a bit optimistic taking into account the environment in which the company operates today with the economic uncertainty. As a business that makes money from advertising, it is difficult to expect that the advertising budgets of the companies will not be cut during this period. However, looking 10 years ahead, I can also not imagine that this segment isn't generating more cash than it is today. So, in my assumptions, I'm using a growth rate of 3%, which leads to 34% revenue growth 10 years from now, which I don't think is too high. When it comes to the margins, I'm using the 40% operating margin. Of course, the operating margin of Meta today won't match with the 40% margin as the reality labs segment is a money-losing segment with lots of R&D being poured in. Using a discount rate of 11.5% today (decreasing to 10.6% over time), the intrinsic value of ""Family of Apps"" is around **$417b**. **Valuation** Now, what's on the balance sheet (cash/debt) together with the outstanding equity options is worth -$1b, which brings the value of Meta to **$416b** if all they had was the cash-generating machine ""Family of Apps"". But there's one more thing to consider. Having two classes of shares gives Mark Zuckerberg the majority voting rights (close to 60%), hence, a discount for lack of control should be applied. If the discount is 15%, then the intrinsic value decreases to **$354b**. The current market cap is $240b, so basically, the market believes the metaverse is going to destroy over $100b of value over time and doesn't believe Zuckerberg's big idea. Is something going to change, is he going to change the path? I'll share a tweet from Professor Damodaran: ""If you invest in a company with dual-class shares, be a realist about what you can and cannot change. Investing in Facebook & complaining that Zuckerberg won't listen to you is like marrying a Kardashian & whining about your privacy being invaded."" **So, what can be done?** Well, the significant share price decline provides an answer that the option always available to the shareholders is to sell their Meta shares, and many of them did exercise this option. **Is Reality labs that bad?** This is a question that will be answered a decade from now. Mark Zuckerberg has said that this segment would contribute a lot to the company's profits in the 2030s. That's a decade from now. Until then, it will consume a significant portion of the cash generated by the ""Family of Apps"". So, the company has been reclassified from a cash-generating machine to a company that pours lots of money into something that might work in the next decade. This uncertainty combined with the power of Zuckerberg to steer the company pushed the price down significantly. Since 2019, **over $36b** have been invested in this new segment. **The Michael Burry tweet** The great big short investor has been right on many occasions, and wrong on probably just as many. One of his tweets was, ""Seems Meta has a New Coke problem."". As always, soon after the tweet was posted, it was deleted. I wasn't familiar with this, but after some research, I stumbled upon an article that helped me understand what this means. Back in April 23rd, 1985, the Chairman and CEO of Coca-Cola stepped before the press introducing a new formula, which was ""smoother, rounder, yet bolder - a more harmonious flavour"". Turns out, this new formula tasted more like Pepsi. What followed was 5,000 angry phone calls per day within weeks, increasing to over 8,000 by June the same year. This means Michael Burry believes that Meta's new vision/strategy is not the best way forward. If it ain't broken, don't fix it. Could he be wrong? Absolutely! There's no certainty when it comes to the value of Reality Labs. The question is, is the ""Reality Labs"" fairly priced today at negative $100b or not. **The different scenarios** What if Michael Burry is right? - If he is right, the question is how long it would take before Mark Zuckerberg pulls the plug. Is the ""Reality Labs"" going to destroy $100b or maybe even more? If the company raises funds to pour even more into the metaverse and turns out to be a failure, Meta could go down significantly even from this low point. What if Mark Zuckerberg is right? - If he's right and Reality Labs is contributing a significant portion of the profits a decade from now, that means Meta is undervalued today. As for me, I have 1 share in Meta, just to be entertained by what's coming next.",0.11492866981503348,1

Is $META going to benefit from Threads?,"One of the questions that many META shareholders have is, what is the impact of Threads on the company’s value?

The answer isn’t simple, and I’ll try to break down the components and share my thoughts.

Mark Zuckerberg shared that monetization options would be explored once Threads hits one billion users (As am I writing this, there are over 83 million users. For comparison, Twitter has close to 400 million).  
  
From Meta’s point of view, the so-called family of Apps includes two social media platforms - Facebook and Instagram. Both of these platforms are in mature monetization stages, where both the revenue per user and the margins are incredibly high.  
  
If we take a look at the big picture, all social media companies make money by selling advertisements. The formula behind that is simple:

**Number of users** X **Time spent on the platform** X **Advertisement revenue**

The time that is being spent is limited, every one of us has 24 hours in a day and decides how to use (or waste) it.  
  
Part of the Facebook/Instagram users will use part of their time using Threads and the impact is obvious. If we take a look at the formula above, it is quite clear that the time spent on Facebook/Instagram will be lower, hence, the revenue generated there is expected to decrease. In addition, as Threads is not monetized, it will only bring additional expenses for keeping the platform up and running. In the short run, there shouldn’t be high expectations for Meta when it comes to the financials.

Whether Threads will generate value, in the long run, depends on a few factors:

\- The # of users that join Threads, from Twitter.

\- The monetization per user of Threads, and how far it will be compared to Facebook/Instagram (So far, Twitter didn’t use its potential)

\- The outcome of the cease-and-desist letter sent to Meta by Spiro (Elon’s lawyer) for creating a “copycat” app.

&#x200B;

Meta's value will increase, only if:  
  
\- The total number of users (Facebook/Instagram/Threads) increases at the expense of Twitter, and;

\- The revenue generated is higher and can cover the additional expenses for running Threads.

(PAYWALL)

From the Article:

Recent revelations and scrutiny from Congress over Facebook's(FB) role in society  could lead to major lawsuits against the social-media giant, according to new  research that drew comparisons with litigation faced by Big Tobacco or Purdue  Pharma. 

Facebook (FB) has been  under pressure following a series of reports by The Wall Street  Journal that made allegations covering Instagram's impact on teenagers'  mental health, whether its algorithm encouraged social discord, and how it  moderates elites. 

A company whistleblower who leaked internal documents to the Journal also  testified before Congress last week, as lawmakers turned their  attention to the renewed public debate over Facebook's(FB) prominent role in peoples' lives. 

Facebook (FB) co-founder  and CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week said that ""many of the claims  don't make any sense,"" pushing back against allegations that arose in the  Journal's reports and the whistleblower's testimony, in a post on social  media. 

Blair Levin, an analyst at London-based technology industry research  group New Street Research, wrote Sunday that "" while we have been  skeptical that past revelations would lead to government action, we think this  time is different and as a result, we think Facebook(FB) may now face a similar challenge from  increased litigation as tobacco, or more recently, OxyContin."" 

Levin served as chief of staff to the chair of the Federal  Communications Commission in the 1990s. 

The analyst said that while the facts and damages are different for Facebook(FB) than those faced by  the tobacco industry or Purdue Pharma -- the maker of opioid medication  OxyContin -- the fundamental legal framework is the same. 

There is a product with problematic consequences for many people, management  knowledge of such, and actions by management ""that not only failed to mitigate  the harm but arguably increased those problematic consequences,"" Levin said. 

In the same way that public outcry against tobacco and opioid makers led to  massive class action and state attorneys general-led lawsuits, Levin said the  recent revelations against Facebook(FB) creates similar incentives to bring  litigation against the company. 

While Facebook(FB) has  faced scrutiny before, there is far more attention on the company this time, in  part because of the role that harms to children plays in the recent allegations,  Levin noted. 

""Discovery is likely to yield even more problematic evidence for Facebook(FB), and the dynamics  create an opportunity for a settlement that would address the issues more  quickly than legislation,"" Levin said. ""We think litigation is likely to be more  damaging to Facebook(FB)  than legislation.""

Meta ordered to suspend Facebook EU data flows as it’s hit with record €1.2BN privacy fine under GDPR,"It’s finally happened: Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, has been hit with a formal suspension order requiring it to stop exporting European Union user data to the US for processing.

Meta’s sanction is for breaching conditions set out in the pan-EU regulation governing transfers of personal data to so-called third countries (in this case the US) without ensuring adequate protections for people’s information.

Facebook changes company name to Meta,"Facebook on Thursday announced that it will change its company name.

The name change, which was announced at the Facebook Connect augmented and virtual reality conference, reflects the company’s growing ambitions beyond social media.

Over the past few years, the company has ramped up its efforts in hardware, introducing a line of Portal video-calling devices, launching the Ray-Ban Stories glasses and rolling out various versions of the Oculus virtual-reality headsets. The company has indicated that augmented and virtual reality will be a key part of its strategy in the coming years.

In July, Facebook announced the formation of a team that would work on the metaverse, a classic sci-fi term Facebook has adopted to describe its vision for working and playing in a virtual world. Two months later, the company said it would elevate Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, who is currently the head of Facebook’s hardware division, to the role of chief technology officer in 2022. And in its third-quarter earnings results on Monday, the company announced that it break out Facebook Reality Labs, its hardware division, into its own reporting segment, starting in the fourth quarter.

Facebook also said this week it’d spend about $10 billion over the next year developing the technologies required for building the metaverse.

Zuckerberg on Thursday also provided a demonstration of the company’s ambitions for the metaverse.

The demo was a Pixar-like animation of software the company hopes to build some day. The demo included users hanging out in space as cartoon-like versions of themselves or fantastical characters, like a robot, that represent their virtual selves.

"Facebook scrambles to escape stock’s death spiral as users flee, sales drop","A year ago, before Facebook had turned [Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META), the social media company was sporting a market cap of [$1 trillion](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/28/facebook-hits-trillion-dollar-market-cap-for-first-time.html), putting it in rarefied territory with a handful of U.S. technology giants.

Today the view looks much different. Meta has lost about two-thirds of its value since peaking in September 2021. The stock is trading at its [lowest](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/16/meta-shares-plunged-14percent-this-week-falling-close-to-their-pandemic-low.html) since January 2019 and is about to close out its third straight quarter of double-digit percentage losses. Only four stocks in the [S&P 500](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance) are having a worse year.

Facebook’s business was built on network effects — users brought their friends and family members, who told their colleagues, who invited their buddies. Suddenly everyone was convening in one place. Advertisers followed, and the company’s ensuing profits — and they were plentiful — provided the capital to recruit the best and brightest engineers to keep the cycle going.

But in 2022, the cycle has reversed. [Users are jumping ship](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-parent-meta-fb-q4-2021-earnings.html) and advertisers are reducing their spending, leaving Meta poised to report its second straight drop in quarterly revenue. Businesses are removing Facebook’s once-ubiquitous [social login button](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/facebook-login-button-disappearing-from-websites-on-privacy-concerns.html) from their websites. Recruiting is an emerging challenge, especially as founder and CEO [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.cnbc.com/mark-zuckerberg/) spends much of his time proselytizing the metaverse, which may be the company’s future but accounts for virtually none of its near-term revenue and is costing billions of dollars a year to build.

Zuckerberg [said](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/founders-letter/) he hopes that within the next decade, the metaverse “will reach a billion people” and “host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce.” He [told](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/22/mark-zuckerberg-envisions-1-billion-people-in-the-metaverse.html) CNBC’s Jim Cramer in June that the “North Star” is to reach those sorts of figures by the end of the decade and create a “massive economy” around digital goods.

Investors aren’t enthusiastic about it, and the way they’re dumping the stock has some observers questioning if the downward pressure is actually a [death spiral](https://twitter.com/heychriscurtis/status/1555934959877074944) from which Meta can’t recover.

“I’m not sure there’s a core business that works anymore at Facebook,” said Laura Martin of Needham, the only analyst among the 45 tracked by FactSet with a sell rating on the stock.

Nobody is suggesting that Facebook is at risk of going out of business. The company still has a dominant position in mobile advertising and has one of the most profitable business models on the planet. Even with a 36% drop in net income in the [latest quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/facebook-parent-meta-earnings-q2-2022.html) from the prior year, Meta generated $6.7 billion in profit and ended the period with over $40 billion in cash and marketable securities.

The Wall Street problem for Facebook is that it’s no longer a growth story. Up until this year, that’s the only thing it’s known. The company’s slowest year for revenue growth was the pandemic year of 2020, when it still expanded 22%. Analysts this year are predicting a revenue drop.

The number of daily active users in the U.S. and Canada has fallen in the past two years, from 198 million in mid-2020 to 197 million in the second quarter of this year. Globally, user numbers are up about 10% over that stretch and are expected to increase 3% a year through 2024, according to FactSet estimates.

“I don’t see it spiraling in terms of cash flows in the next few years, but I’m just worried that they’re not winning the next generation,” said Jeremy Bondy, CEO of app marketing firm Liftoff.

Sales growth is expected to hover in the single digits for the first half of 2023, before ticking back up. But even that bet carries risks. The next generation, as Bondy describes it, is now [moving over to TikTok](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/29/tiktok-looms-large-in-tech-earnings-from-google-facebook-amazon.html), where users can create and view short, viral videos rather than scrolling past political rants from distant relatives with whom they mistakenly connected on Facebook.

Meta has been trying to mimic TikTok’s success with its short video offering called Reels, which has been a major focus across Facebook and Instagram. Meta plans to increase the amount of algorithmically recommended short videos in users’ Instagram feeds from 15% to 30%, and Bondy speculates the company will likely “get tremendous revenue flow from that” algorithmic shift.

However, Facebook acknowledges it’s early days for monetizing Reels, and it’s not yet clear how well the format works for advertisers. TikTok’s business remains opaque because the company is privately held and owned by China’s ByteDance.

[Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.cnbc.com/sheryl-sandberg/), who’s [leaving](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/01/facebook-coo-sheryl-sandberg-says-she-is-stepping-down.html) the company Friday after more than 14 years as chief operating officer, said in her final earnings call in July that videos are harder than photos in terms of ads and measurement, and that Facebook has to show businesses how to use the ad tools for Reels.

“I think it’s very promising,” Sandberg said, “but we’ve got some hard work ahead of us.”

Skeptics such as Martin see Facebook pushing users away from the core news feed, where it makes tons of cash, and toward Reels, where the model is unproven. Martin says Zuckerberg must know something important about where the business is headed.

“He wouldn’t be hurting its revenue at the same time he needs more money, unless he felt like the core business wasn’t strong enough to stand alone,” Martin said. “He must feel he has to try to move his viewership to Reels to compete with TikTok.”

A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment for this story.

Zuckerberg has at least one major reason for concern beyond just stalled user growth and a slowing economy: [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL).

The 2021 iOS privacy update, called App Tracking Transparency, undermined Facebook’s ability to target users with ads, costing the company an estimated [$10 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html) in revenue this year. Meta is counting on artificial intelligence-powered advertising to eventually make up for Apple’s changes.

That may amount to little more than a Band-Aid. Chris Curtis, an online marketing expert and consultant, has seen social networks rise and fall as trends change and users move along. And that problem isn’t solvable with AI.

“I’m old enough, and I was there when MySpace was a thing,” said Curtis, who previously worked at [Anheuser-Busch](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BUD) and McKinsey. “Social networks are switchable, right?”

When you look at Meta’s user numbers, Curtis said, they suggest the company is “not in a good position.”

## ‘Force for good or evil’

The last time Facebook’s market cap was this low, it was early 2019 and the company was dealing with the continued fallout of the [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/facebook-cambridge-analytica-a-timeline-of-the-data-hijacking-scandal.html)privacy scandal. Since then, Facebook has suffered further reputational damage, most notably from the documents leaked last year by whistleblower and former employee [Frances Haugen](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-ahead-of-60-minutes-interview.html).

The main takeaway from the Haugen saga, which preceded the name change to Meta, was that Facebook knew of many of the harms its products caused kids and was unwilling or unable to do anything about them. Some U.S. senators compared the company to [Big Tobacco](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/30/senators-say-facebook-used-big-tobacco-playbook-to-exploit-kids.html).

[Denise Lee Yohn](https://deniseleeyohn.com/), author of brand-building books including “What Great Brands Do” and “Fusion,” said there’s little evidence to suggest that Facebook’s rebranding to Meta late last year has changed public perception of the company.

“I think the company still suffers from a lot of criticism and skepticism about whether they are a force for good or evil,” Yohn said.

Rehabilitating a damaged brand is difficult but not impossible, Yohn said. She noted that in 2009, [Domino’s Pizza](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DPZ) was able to successfully come back from a crisis. In April of that year, a video made as a [prank](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/business/media/16dominos.html) by two restaurant employees went viral, showing one of them doing disgusting acts with food while cooking in one of the company’s kitchens. Both employees were arrested and charged with food contamination.

In December 2009, Domino’s launched a marketing blitz called the [“Pizza Turnaround.”](https://blog.unincorporated.com/dominos-brand-crisis) The stock climbed 63% in the first quarter of 2010.

Yohn said the company’s approach was, “We’ve been told our pizzas suck, and so we’re actually going to make substantive changes to what we are offering and change people’s perceptions.” While it sounded initially like “just marketing speak,” Yohn said, “they actually really did change.”

Zuckerberg, on the other hand, is not “coming across as a leader who is serious about changing his culture and about changing himself and about kind of creating a company that will be able to step into the future that he’s envisioning,” she said.

Meta’s reputational hit could also harm the company’s ability to recruit top-tier talent, a stark contrast to a decade ago, when there was no more prized landing spot for a hotshot engineer.

A former Facebook ad executive, who spoke on condition that his name not be used, told CNBC that even though TikTok is owned by a Chinese parent, it now has an edge over Meta when it comes to recruiting because it’s viewed as having less “moral downside.”

[Ben Zhao](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/), a computer science professor at University of Chicago, said he’s seeing that play out on the ground as an increasing number of students in his department are showing interest in working for TikTok and ByteDance.

In order to stay competitive, given how the market has punished tech stocks this year, Zhao said, Meta and [Google](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL) are “having to pay more and are having certainly to hand out more lucrative stock options and packages.”

## The bull case

Still, Zuckerberg has a history of proving his doubters wrong, said Jake Dollarhide, the CEO of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Dollarhide remembers when investors ran from Facebook not long after its 2012 IPO, scoffing at the company’s ability to move “from the PC to the mobile world.” Facebook’s mobile business quickly caught fire and by late 2013, the stock was off to the races.

Zuckerberg’s success in pivoting to mobile gives Dollarhide confidence that Meta can cash in on its bet-the-farm move to the metaverse. In the second quarter, Meta’s Reality Labs division, which houses its virtual reality headsets and related technologies, generated $452 million in revenue, about 1.5% of total Meta sales, and [lost $2.8 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/meta-reality-labs-lost-2point8-billion-in-q2-2022.html#:~:text=Meta%20lost%20%242.8%20billion%20on%20its%20virtual%20reality%20ambitions%20during%20Q2,-Published%20Wed%2C%20Jul&amp;text=Facebook%20parent%20Meta%20lost%20%242.8,the%20quarter%20ending%20in%20June.).

“I think Zuckerberg is very bright and very ambitious,” said Dollarhide. “I wouldn’t bet against Zuckerberg just like I wouldn’t bet against [Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/).”

Dollarhide’s firm hasn’t owned Facebook shares, though, since 2014, preferring the trajectory of tech companies such as Apple and [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN), two of his top holdings.

“The reality is they can be perceived as a value company and not a growth company,” Dollarhide said, regarding Meta.

No matter what happens in the next year or two or even three, Zuckerberg has made clear that the future of the company is in the metaverse, where he’s banking on new businesses forming around virtual reality.

Zhao, from University of Chicago, says there’s immense uncertainty surrounding the metaverse’s prospects.

“The real question is — are daily users ready for the metaverse yet?” Zhao said. “Is the underlying technology ready and mature enough to make that transition seamless? That’s a real question and that may not be all up to Facebook or Meta at this point.”

If Zuckerberg is right, perhaps 10 years from now Meta’s stock price from the depths of 2022 will look like the discount of the decade. And if that happens, predictions of a death spiral will be mocked like a 2012 [cover story from Barron’s](https://ritholtz.com/2012/09/barrons-covers-story-facebook-worth-15/), headlined “Facebook is worth $15” with a thumb pointing down. Four years later, it was trading near $130.

"Losses of Apple, Amazon and Facebook bring down stock market"," 

US stocks fell to their lowest level in two weeks, with the shares of major technology companies under pressure for the second day, due to concerns that valuations were too high for this year's performance.

The declines of Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook pushed the Nasdaq 100, the index of the 100 largest non-financial companies, down more than 5%, although it reduced those losses by more than half as the day progressed and investors found bargains. The broader market fared better, with the S&P 500 index dropping just over 1% in the afternoon.

US Treasury yields increased while the dollar remained stable. Oil dropped to less than $ 40 a barrel for the first time in a month.

According to Bloomberg, Friday's biggest sales appeared to stem from concerns that the recent surge in technology stocks was not linked to broad investor sentiment, but instead would have been driven by overseas options trading. a company.

The Financial Times reported that SoftBank bought billions of dollars in technology derivatives before the crash that started Thursday.

Facebook wants to charge EU users $14 a month if they don't agree to personalized ads on Facebook and Instagram,"Meta is considering introducing subscription-based, ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram in Europe. The move aims to comply with the EU's new ad privacy regulations. The subscription fee would start at around €10 ($10.50) for desktop users and rise to about $14 for mobile users, accounting for commissions charged by Apple and Google's app stores. The subscription model is still under review for compliance with EU laws. This comes after Meta faced a $1.3 billion fine from European regulators for data privacy violations.

**Regulatory Arbitrage**:
Meta's decision can be viewed as a form of regulatory arbitrage, aimed at circumventing the stringent data privacy laws enforced by the European Union. Given the EU's propensity for imposing substantial fines, this move could serve as a risk mitigation strategy, thereby stabilizing the company's regulatory profile.

**Revenue Diversification and Financial Stability**:
The introduction of a subscription-based revenue model is a strategic pivot away from the increasingly volatile ad-based revenue streams. This diversification could serve to stabilize Meta's cash flows, thereby making it a more attractive and less risky investment in the long term.

**Market Test for Global Scalability**:
The European market will act as a bellwether for the viability of this new revenue model. A successful implementation in Europe could pave the way for a global rollout, offering a significant upside potential for revenue growth and stock appreciation.

**Industry Precedence and Competitive Moats**:
By being the first to introduce a subscription-based model in the social media landscape, Meta has the opportunity to build a competitive moat. This first-mover advantage could deter competitors from entering the space, thereby consolidating Meta's market share and potentially driving up its valuation.

**User Adoption as a Leading Indicator**:
The rate of user adoption will serve as a leading indicator for the success of this initiative. High adoption rates could signify a paradigm shift in consumer preferences, moving away from ad-supported to subscription-based models. This could have a ripple effect on Meta's long-term revenue and profitability metrics.

Facebook/Meta price move shows that no individual stock is 100% safe,"It's a lesson that everyone who invests in individual stocks should keep at the back of his mind. Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook have been praised on here for many years as stocks that will  outperform the overall market with relative safety. It's very possible that Meta will grow for years to come, and the stock will recover, but at this exact moment:

"Facebook, you either hate it or...hate it","I always knew that the average investor was too lazy to question the truthfulness (or accuracy) of the information available out there and run a quality check but the recent debate on Facebook made me realize that the average investor is even lazier than I thought.

In the last few days I read so many posts and comments about the Apple's privacy changes and their impact on revenue of Facebook. For many, the best days of Facebook are behind the company.

It's interesting how this issue comes up almost exclusively in discussions about Facebook, when among all companies that generate revenue from online ads (hey there, Google), it is the best positioned one in order to handle this change. Why? Because the feature **requires app developers to ask for permissions before they track people's activity across apps or websites they don’t own in order to target advertising to them** and Facebook, given the nature of its business, **still has access to an enormous amount of high quality data**.

It's obvious that Apple's feature does not allow Facebook to harvest data as effectively as it did before, but you know, you can deny Facebook permission to track your data across apps or websites it doesn’t own as much as you want but if you then log in on Facebook (or Instagram, for that matter) to write a post about how good the Big Mac that you had for lunch was, you're still providing Facebook with a mountain of valuable data.

Before Apple launched its new App Tracking Transparency feature in iOS 14.5, Facebook had complete control of its game. What about now that this feature is available then? Apple global smartphone market Share is about 30%. Of that 30%, 86% of iOS devices are running a recent enough version of the software to be presented with ATT prompts, according to an October report from AppsFlyer. Of the people who see the pop-up, **38% are still opting-in**, and 62% are opting-out. Being 100% the global smartphone market share, **only about 16% is using the feature**. Yep, the days of Facebook are definitely numbered.

One of the posts that really stuck with me was the one arguing that now it's just about iOS devices but pretty soon also Android will follow suit. What makes you think that Alphabet, whose revenue is mainly derived from online ads, is rushing to provide Android users with the chance to ""opt-out"" if they don't want apps and websites to track their data?

Also, to all those people who hate Facebook so much that can't help but write about how much they hate Facebook on every other social media (which, by the way, do exactly the same thing that Facebook does, just on a smaller scale), don't you find it a little hypocrite to hate that much Facebook for doing what it does with your data but have nothing to say on the companies (and I guess that only few would not make it in this list) that exploit those data to aggressively push for their products (hey there, Apple)?

The top watchdog of American business is also home to Washington’s most active Wall Street investors.

The Federal Trade Commission in recent years has opened investigations into nearly every major industry. It has launched antitrust probes into technology companies, examined credit card firms and moved to restrict drug, energy and defense-company mergers.

At the same time, senior officials at the FTC disclosed more trades of stocks, bonds and funds, on average, than officials at any other major agency in a Wall Street Journal review of financial disclosures at 50 federal agencies from 2016 to 2021.

Many of the investments overlapped with the FTC’s work.

A third of its 90 senior officials owned or traded stock in companies that were undergoing an FTC merger review or investigation, based on actions the agency has made public.

FTC officials owned stock in 22 of the roughly 60 large companies the FTC brought cases against in the period reviewed.

The officials were most heavily invested in technology, an industry that has come under increasing scrutiny by the agency. Nearly one in four top FTC officials owned or traded individual stocks of tech companies such as Amazon. com Inc., MetaPlatforms Inc.’s Facebook, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp.

An FTC chairman owned Microsoft, Oracle and AT&T Inc. while the agency was conducting sensitive reviews affecting the tech and telecom sectors.

The head of the FTC’s international division bought and sold Facebook stock through a financial adviser as his office coordinated with overseas enforcement officials on an investigation involving Facebook.

And an FTC consumer-protection official owned stock in more than 10 companies as the agency scrutinized mergers or acquisitions involving the firms.

"Apple already decimated Meta’s ad-tech empire. Now, it’s homing in on Facebook’s advertisers, too.","In terms of Silicon Valley feuds, you’d be hard pressed to find one that’s spicier than the years-long battle between Meta and Apple. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg started steering his company toward virtual-reality tech, and now Apple CEO Tim Cook has made it clear he’s gunning for the same. Meta’s Facebook recently started testing out encrypted chats, a domain that Apple has dominated for years. 

Facebook is a company that historically hasn’t shied away from sharing user data with countless third parties. Meanwhile Apple AAPL, -0.67%, as its own glitzy ad campaigns constantly remind us, is the one tech company that doesn’t spray your data across the web. And, of course, there’s Apple’s recent privacy changes to its operating system that wiped out an estimated $10 billion of revenue for Meta META, -0.54%. At the same time, the advertisers that relied on the long-established tools on Facebook and Instagram were left without the data they long relied on for their businesses.

In the year since Apple CEO Tim Cook denounced ad-based business models as a source of real-world violence, Apple has ramped up plans to pop more ads into people’s iPhones and beef up the tech used to target those ads. And now it looks like Apple’s looking to poach the small businesses that have relied almost entirely on Facebook’s ad platform for more than a decade. MarketWatch found two recent job postings by Apple that suggest the company is looking to build out its burgeoning ad-tech team with folks who specialize in working with small businesses. Specifically, the company says it’s looking for two product managers who are “inspired to make a difference in how digital advertising will work in a privacy-centric world” and who want to “design and build consumer advertising experiences.” An ideal candidate, Apple said, won’t only be savvy in advertising and mobile tech, and advertising on mobile tech, but will also have experience with “performance marketing, local ads or enabling small businesses.” 

The listings also state that Apple’s looking for a manager who can “drive multi-year strategy and execution,” which suggests that Apple isn’t just tailing local advertisers but will likely be tailing those advertisers for a while. And considering how some of those small brands are already looking to jump ship from Facebook following Apple’s privacy changes, luring them off the platform might be enough to hamper Meta’s entire business structure for good, ad-tech analysts said. “If you talk to any small business, they’ll tell you, ‘Yeah, right now is a disaster,” said Eric Seufert, one analyst who’s been following the battle between Apple and Facebook evolve for  years. “It’s just a meltdown. There’s been a complete, devastating change to the environment.”

DOJ sues Apple over iPhone monopoly,"The Department of Justice sued Apple on Thursday, saying its iPhone ecosystem is a monopoly that drove its “astronomical valuation” at the expense of consumers, developers and rival phone makers.

Federal antitrust enforcement and 17 attorneys general also say that Apple’s anti-competitive practices extend beyond the iPhone and Apple Watch businesses, citing Apple’s advertising, browser, FaceTime and news offerings.

“Each step in Apple’s course of conduct built and reinforced the moat around its smartphone monopoly,” the complaint filed in the District of New Jersey said. Apple shares were down around 1.8% as investors anticipated the lawsuit.

The Justice Department said in a release that to keep consumers buying iPhones, Apple moved to block cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party wallet and smartwatch compatibility and disrupted non-App Store programs and cloud-streaming services.

The challenge represents a significant risk to Apple’s walled-garden business model. The company says that complying with regulations costs the company money, could prevent it from introducing new products or services, and could hurt customer demand.

The lawsuit could force Apple to make changes in some of its most valuable businesses: The iPhone, in which Apple reported over $200 billion in sales in 2023, the Apple Watch, part of the company’s $40 billion wearables business, and its profitable services line, which reported $85 billion in revenue.

“If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the release.

Apple said in a statement that it disagreed with the premise of the lawsuit and that it would defend against it.

“This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect,” an Apple spokesperson told CNBC. “It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.”

The lawsuit follows years of investigations into Apple’s business practices and two prior DOJ cases against Apple: One over e-book prices and another over allegations that it colluded with other technology companies to depress salaries.

“This anticompetitive behavior is designed to maintain Apple’s monopoly power while extracting as much revenue as possible,” the complaint said.

iMessage, Apple Watch, and cloud gaming

The complaint highlights comments from CEO Tim Cook and other executives. Some users have asked Apple to improve Android-to-iPhone messaging. Developers have gone as far as creating apps that can circumvent the platform limitations, only to be shut down by Apple.

Prosecutors highlighted one exchange between Cook and a consumer.

“Not to make it personal but I can’t send my mom certain videos,” the complaint says one user told Cook, referring to a 2022 interview at a Vox Media event.

“Buy your mom an iPhone,” Cook responded.

The DOJ is also focusing on Apple’s smartwatch, Apple Watch, saying the company designed it to only work with iPhones, and not Android devices. The company’s decision means that “users who purchase the Apple Watch face substantial out-of-pocket costs if they do not keep buying iPhones,” according to the complaint.

The DOJ said Apple has fought cloud streaming services on its App Store platform, blocking consumer access to high-quality video games on iPhones, echoing complaints from Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta.

Apple has faced several significant antitrust challenges more recently, largely focused on its control over the iPhone App Store. It mostly won in a civil suit against Epic Games in 2021, although it made concessions during the trial and had to make some changes to its policies under California law.

“Today’s lawsuit seeks to hold Apple accountable and ensure it cannot deploy the same, unlawful playbook in other vital markets,” Assistant Attorney General for antitrust Jonathan Kanter said in the release.

The company is currently jockeying with the European Commission over whether it’s complying with a new Digital Markets Act, which forces Apple to open up the iPhone app store to rivals such as Microsoft or Epic Games. Apple plans to charge big companies that eschew its app store 50 cents per download.

Apple was fined $2 billion in the EU over a dispute with Spotify about whether the music streaming service can link to its website and account system inside of its app.

Apple had 64% of the market share for U.S. iPhones in the last quarter of 2023, versus 18% for Samsung, according to Counterpoint Research.

Apple isn’t the only big tech company facing government scrutiny. The DOJ filed an antitrust case against Google in 2020 over its dominant search position and another year over its advertising business. The DOJ also famously sued Microsoft in the 1990s, eventually forcing it to allow users to unbundle the Internet Explorer browser from the Windows operating system.

"Apple is gaining on Facebook and Google in online ads after iOS privacy change, report shows","The Google-Facebook online ad duopoly may be breaking up. According to a study published Tuesday by Appsumer, Apple is gaining momentum in digital ads, while Google and Facebook appear to be losing steam. The research, based on an analysis of the online ad budgets of over 100 different consumer app companies, found that Apple’s ad business has benefited from the company’s major iOS privacy update in 2021, which made it more difficult for companies like Facebook to track users across the Internet. Apple’s search ads let people advertise on the iPhone maker’s App Store. Advertiser adoption rate for the second quarter rose almost 4 percentage points from a year earlier to 94.8%, while Facebook adoption fell 3 percentage points to 82.8%, Appsumer said. Google’s rate declined 2 points to 94.8%.

Apple has “joined the duopoly of Facebook and Google at the top table of advertiser adoption,” according to Appsumer, which is owned by InMobi. Shumel Lais, general manager at Appsumer, attributed Apple’s improved standing to an increase in the number of app developers willing to pay big money to bolster downloads. At the same time, Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) update has limited the amount of data ad-based apps like Facebook can use to help brands with their online ad campaigns. “One of the things that’s quite interesting is the ATT measurement limitations that are kind of put on the wider network doesn’t exist in the same way for Apple,” Lais said. “So you could say Apple has slightly more visibility or an advantage across the other channels on iOS.”

Apple’s rise in online ads for developers mirrors Amazon’s position in e-commerce, as retailers spend more money to promote their products on the site they rely on for customers. In terms of overall app developer spend on online advertising, referred to as share of wallet, Google remains at the top, with 34%. Facebook is second at 28%, followed by Apple at 15%.

According to a study published Tuesday by Appsumer, Apple is gaining momentum in digital ads, while Google and Facebook appear to be losing steam. The research, based on an analysis of the online ad budgets of over 100 different consumer app companies, found that Apple’s ad business has benefited from the company’s major iOS privacy update in 2021, which made it more difficult for companies like Facebook to track users across the Internet. Apple’s search ads let people advertise on the iPhone maker’s App Store. Advertiser adoption rate for the second quarter rose almost 4 percentage points from a year earlier to 94.8%, while Facebook adoption fell 3 percentage points to 82.8%, Appsumer said. Google’s rate declined 2 points to 94.8%. Apple has “joined the duopoly of Facebook and Google at the top table of advertiser adoption,” according to Appsumer, which is owned by InMobi. Shumel Lais, general manager at Appsumer, attributed Apple’s improved standing to an increase in the number of app developers willing to pay big money to bolster downloads. At the same time, Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) update has limited the amount of data ad-based apps like Facebook can use to help brands with their online ad campaigns. “One of the things that’s quite interesting is the ATT measurement limitations that are kind of put on the wider network doesn’t exist in the same way for Apple,” Lais said. “So you could say Apple has slightly more visibility or an advantage across the other channels on iOS.” Apple’s rise in online ads for developers mirrors Amazon’s position in e-commerce, as retailers spend more money to promote their products on the site they rely on for customers.

Facebook: Sinking Ship or Not?,"To  start off, I'm long-term bullish  on Facebook. I think they're a  well-positioned company with lean  operations, good cash reserves, low  debt. There's obviously a lot of  controversy around the company recently  and there are good reasons for  that. However, I think they're finally  being forced to address these,  which should ultimately be good for  business.

The  current drop of  Facebook was extremely exaggerated in my personal  opinion. The drop in  users was 1 million out of... 1.93 BILLION. Less  than 0.05% loss of  users! That also comes after a pandemic boost so,  even though it's not a  great sight, it's not as bad as people make it  out to be.

Plus,  the main reason  why Facebook missed earnings was due to their  investments in Reality  Labs, e.g. their AR and VR branch. Facebook's  core business actually  grew and we can also see that in their revenue  which is up 20% YoY.  Does it make sense to punish the stock for trying  to get ahead of the  market in a brand new sector? It makes no sense.  IIRC, AR and VR are  meant to be a $300 bln market within 10 years or so.  Facebook is one of  the pioneers there along with other mega-cap tech  giants. The revenue  and earnings potential there is absolutely massive  so it would make  sense for FB to try to spearhead it as much as  possible.

I'm  not a fan of Zuck and co., but I think we have to admit they've built  something phenomenal  (although frightening). It's a solid business and  trading at a PE of 17  is crazy IMO. How many other companies at that PE  ratio seen revenue  growth of 20%? I mean, Coca Cola has a PE of 30!

Long   story short, I'm long-term bullish although seeing how the markets   reacted, I can't see Facebook hitting $300 again in the next 3 months,   possibly 6 to 12 months. However, I think it's a good time for anyone to  add to their position which is what I'm doing (although I only own  something like 1.2 shares of FB right now).",stocks,Facebook,"Facebook: Sinking Ship or Not?

Facebook's disastrous results are bad news for Snap and other companies that risk losing billions of dollars from Apple's privacy changes,"Facebook's disastrous results on Wednesday show how a privacy crackdown by Apple last year is having a longer and larger impact on the digital 
advertising industry
, with billions of dollars due to be lost this year alone. Snap, Twitter and Pinterest may be next in line for a hammering. 

Apple's iOS 14.5 update in April let users opt out of tracking by apps and disrupted how many tech companies target and measure ads. 

David Wehner, Facebook's CFO, said on Wednesday that the company expects to lose $10 billion in 2021 due to the ongoing impact of these changes. This is more than the expected financial impact Apple's moves had last year on Facebook, Snap, and Twitter combined. 

""It's a pretty significant headwind on our business,"" Wehner said. Facebook's stock plunged 23% in late trading after the results, which included a big miss on revenue from its metaverse segment, Reality Labs.

Investors are now bracing for similar financial carnage at rivals such as Snap, Twitter and Pinterest. Shares of those 3 companies dropped 17%, 8%, and 9%, respectively in after-hours trading on Wednesday. 

Snap took a big hit last year, saying in its third-quarter results that Apple's alternative ad tools did not work as well as anticipated. The company missed revenue guidance and its stock has steadily fallen in recent months. Like Facebook, before the new privacy controls rolled out, Snap had said it would be able to avoid a serious financial hit. Snap reports fourth-quarter results Feb. 3.

Last year, Twitter CFO Ned Segal said the company saw a ""modest"" impact from the Apple changes in the third quarter, noting it was ""lower than expected."" Twitter reports next on Feb. 10. 

Pinterest has said it expects ""varying degrees of impact for advertisers on audiences, measurement and reporting, and conversion campaigns."" Pinterest's earnings report is due Feb. 3.

During a conference call with analysts on Wednesday, Facebook's Wehner took aim at Apple for its deal with Google to have that search engine be the default on its devices. The executive suggested this arrangement creates an ""incentive"" for the iPhone maker to treat Google better than Facebook and other digital 
ad companies
. The impending launch of iOS 15 will create even more of an impact, he added, along with new data privacy regulations in Europe.

""There's a clear trend where less data is available for personalized ads,"" Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and CEO, said on the call. ""We're rebuilding a lot of our advertising infrastructure so we can continue to grow and deliver personalized ads.""

Such rebuilding will take time. COO Sheryl Sandberg said the business impact will ""moderately"" increase in the first quarter of 2022, and then continue through the year. The company is still receiving ""less granular"" conversion data, or information about what ads result in a user making a purchase or taking another action. And it's coming on a ""delayed basis,"" she said. Measurement of ad targeting and reach is still taking a big hit. 

""It's very much a multi-year effort to rebuild our ad targeting,"" Sandberg said.

It's a different tone than the company took for much of last year. Facebook previously said it was working to ""mitigate"" any impact. Sandberg said in July it was ""on us to keep making the case that personalized advertising is good for people and businesses."" Wehner mentioned the use of Facebook's own Aggregated Events Management for ad targeting, saying the goal was to ""even improve performance with less data.""",stocks,Facebook,"Facebook's disastrous results are bad news for Snap and other companies that risk losing billions of dollars from Apple's privacy changes Facebook's disastrous results on Wednesday show how a privacy crackdown by Apple last year is having a longer and larger impact on the digital advertising industry , with billions of dollars due to be lost this year alone.

"Snap’s Financial Update Was So Bad, Facebook and Twitter Stocks Are Falling, Too","Snap stock plunged in late trading Thursday after the social-networking firm posted disappointing revenue growth and guidance that fell shy of estimates. The parent of Snapchat said its advertising revenue was hurt more than expected by Apple ‘s change in the rules surrounding advertising on mobile apps. The miss weighed heavy on shares of other major social-media companies. Snap (ticker: SNAP) stock was down 21% in premarket trading Friday. Facebook (FB) was down 3.9% on the news, while Twitter (TWTR) was off 4.5%, Pinterest (PINS) had fallen 2.6%, and Alphabet (GOOGL) had slipped 1.8%. Snap is the first of the companies to report September quarter results.

For the third quarter, Snap posted revenue of $1.067 billion, up 57% from a year ago, and below the company’s guidance range of $1.07 billion to $1.085 billion. Adjusted Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, was $174 million, well above its guidance range of $110 million to $120 million. On a non-GAAP basis, the company earned 17 cents a share in the quarter, beating the Street consensus of 8 cents a share. The company said it grew daily average users in the quarter by more than 20% to 306 million.

For the fourth quarter, Snap is projecting revenue of $1.165 billion to $1.205 billion, well shy of the Street consensus forecast of $1.36 billion. Snap is projecting adjusted Ebitda for the quarter of between $135 million and $175 million.

Snap blamed the miss in part on changes in Apple’s (AAPL) advertising tracking practices that make it harder to track consumer behavior across apps and websites. “Our advertising business was disrupted by changes to iOS ad tracking that were broadly rolled out by Apple in June and July,” the company said in remarks prepared for the company’s earnings conference call. “While we anticipated some degree of business disruption, the new Apple-provided measurement solution did not scale as we had expected, making it more difficult for our advertising partners to measure and manage their ad campaigns for iOS.” Snap said the issue “was compounded by the ongoing macroeconomic effects of the global pandemic, with our advertising partners facing a variety of supply-chain interruptions and labor shortages.” The company said that factor reduced the “short-term appetite to generate additional customer demand through advertising at a time when their businesses are already supply-constrained.”

Snap added that Apple’s changes have “upended many of the industry norms and advertiser behaviors that were built on IDFA, Apple’s unique device identifier for advertising, over the past decade, which now require a double opt-in by users in order to access directly.” The company noted that Apple has rolled out a proprietary solution known as SKAdNetwork, or SKAN, to allow app-based advertisers to continue measuring their advertising on iOS. But it says results have been disappointing. “The initial results we observed using SKAN were generally aligned with prior industry-standard solutions, and we were among the first platforms to lean into this solution and push for widespread industry adoption,” the company said. “However, over time, we saw SKAN measurement results diverge meaningfully from the results we observed on other first- and third-party measurement solutions, making SKAN unreliable as a standalone measurement solution.”

Why I fail to see how the Metaverse will succeed,"I've read that a lot of people here are super bullish on the Metaverse and various ""digital words""

As a VR consumer and developer I however am very skeptical that the masses will flock to an digital world.

The metaverse is not a new concept, its been around since the 90s if not further back. There is already a form of metaverse called ""Second life"" where you can own properties, join communities and pretty much ""live"" in a real world.

&#x200B;

Now I know a lot of people will say that we simply don't know the possibilities yet and we are thinking too simple minded but let's be creative. What could be some use cases that people would prefer doing digital vs real life?

Metaverse cinema? Yeah that already exists in current VR games and it's really not that fun and you obviously can't recreate the pixel density nor the actual sound acoustic that a lot of people don't get from their home system.

&#x200B;

Meetings? Yeah I guess if you prefer to strap a VR headset on you and be forced to see your digital coworkers instead of having a 2D Teams screen where you can actually do something else than stare at your coworkers during the meeting.

&#x200B;

Dating? I almost don't want to go into this. Are you telling me a digital date would surpass the actual real life vision of a human, the smells, the toucing hand? 

&#x200B;

Virtual jog by the beach? I literally saw this example on the sub. You think people would really want to jog in a virtual beach oppose to actually going outside?

&#x200B;

Whatever the metaverse is it will be a subpar experience to the real thing. Unless we can advance graphic rendering by a hella of a lot or actually tapping into our senses I fail to see how the metaverse would ""awe"" anyone. 

&#x200B;

If we do go fully Inception, ""simulation"" reality then we got bigger issues than the Metaverse.

Running out of cash… Should I sell my Apple and Facebook?,"Hi all ♥️

I am quickly running out of cash. I have always had a little cushion in my portfolio of Apple and Facebook stock, but not much… Only about $50,000 worth.

I was hoping to hold them long-term, but wondering at this point if I should go ahead and sell them. That is all I have, and worried that their value will be a lot lower when I need to access funds, which will probably be in about two months.

"Facebook/Meta ""fair value estimate"" at Morningstar is 400/share.","> Meta Platforms, the parent of Facebook, reported mixed fourth-quarter 2021 results. Revenue was slightly ahead of expectations but the firm missed on the bottom line. We have slightly lowered our revenue growth assumptions for Meta, resulting in a $400 fair value estimate.

> Total fourth-quarter revenue came in at $33.7 billion, up 20% year over year. Advertising revenue increased 25% as businesses continued to allocate their ad dollars to Meta’s platforms. The family monthly active people count increased to 3.59 billion during the quarter, from 3.58 billion in the previous quarter and 3.3 billion the year before. Average revenue generated per person increased 9% from last year and 15% from the prior quarter, indicative of healthy advertising demand. With increase in investments in metaverse and the firm’s advertising offerings, operating margin declined nearly five percentage points to around 33% during the quarter.


FWIW.  

I'm starting to nibble, personally.  Buying initial position in 1/3rds (starting today @ 219/share), then possibly slowly adding more depending on how other individual stocks do, affecting my cash position.

"Facebook-parent Meta planning more layoffs, to impact thousands: Report","Facebook-parent Meta Platforms is planning a fresh round of job cuts in a reorganization and downsizing effort that could affect thousands of workers, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday.

Meta plans to push some leaders into lower-level roles without direct reports, flattening the layers of management between top boss Mark Zuckerberg and the company's interns, the Washington Post reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.

In November last year, Meta said it had laid off 11,000 employees, a little over a tenth of its global workforce, days after Twitter let go of nearly half its workforce.

The company is also considering more traditional cuts, including slashing some projects and jobs. These efforts, targeted at divisions across the company and worldwide, may not happen on a single day, but will likely roll out in the coming months.

Zuckerberg proclaimed 2023 the “year of efficiency,” promising investors he would trim middle management and speed up the company’s decision-making, hinting at the possibility of more cuts.

"Microsoft is bigger than Google, Amazon and Facebook. But now lawmakers treat it like an ally in antitrust battles.","More than 24 hours after Microsoft announced its plans to purchase Activision for nearly $70 billion, aggressive trustbusters in Congress were uncharacteristically quiet.

The silence underscores how Microsoft has carved out a distinct reputation among policymakers, distancing itself from the political scrutiny embroiling its top competitors in Washington. As Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google were marshaling their Washington resources to beat back competition legislation up for debate on Capitol Hill this week, Microsoft smoothly announced one of the largest acquisitions in the history of the tech industry.

The lack of scrutiny could be in part due to Microsoft’s reputation as an enterprise tech business, which does not necessarily generate the same headlines as social media, smartphones or e-commerce, according to Harry First, co-director of Competition, Innovation and Information Law program at New York University.

Microsoft is also less exposed to the content moderation controversies that have enveloped Facebook and Google’s YouTube, which have faced political blowback for their controversial handling of incendiary and harmful posts. As gatekeepers to digital marketplaces, Apple and Amazon have been pulled into political controversies; for instance, when they pulled support for the conservative social network Parler in the fallout of the Jan. 6 attacks. But Microsoft’s key social service, LinkedIn, is focused on business networking, leaving it less vulnerable to political disputes.

Reddit overtakes X in popularity of social media platforms in UK $RDDT,"[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/reddit-overtakes-x-in-popularity-of-social-media-platforms-in-uk](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/reddit-overtakes-x-in-popularity-of-social-media-platforms-in-uk)

Reddit, the American online discussion platform, has overtaken X to become the fifth most popular social media platform in the UK, according to the communications watchdog.

Ofcom said Reddit, where users post on discussion threads within topic-based communities, was visited by 22.9 million UK adults in May this year, compared with 22.1 million on X.

The figures make Reddit the fastest-growing large social media platform in the UK and represent a growth of 47% on the same period in 2023. The leap took Reddit above LinkedIn and X into fifth place on the table of UK social media platforms, which is now topped by YouTube after it overtook [Facebook](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook), reaching more than 44 million adults.

Reddit, renowned for its devoted user base who refer to one another as Redditors, appears to have been boosted by updates to Google’s search engine this year.

Farhad Divecha, the managing director of the UK-based digital marketing agency AccuraCast, said: “Google’s latest algorithm update in the first half of 2024 gave Reddit a big boost in organic search traffic. I think that has probably contributed a lot.”

Ofcom also speculated that the change may have been caused [by alterations to how third-party apps accessed its content](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/14/reddit-moderators-vow-to-continue-blackout-in-api-access-fees-row), forcing users of those apps to switch to the Reddit site. The watchdog also flagged publicity around Reddit’s stock market flotation in March this year.

The popularity of X also fell over the same period, according to Ofcom, with its reach falling by 8% since May last year. X has been criticised over content moderation standards since its [takeover by Elon Musk in 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/28/elon-musk-twitter-hate-speech-concerns-stock-exchange-deal) but it has also faced competition since July 2023 from Threads, a rival to X [launched by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/06/meta-launches-twitter-rival-threads-in-100-countries).

The Ofcom figures featured in the watchdog’s annual report into the nation’s digital habits, which revealed that four out of 10 UK adults say they have encountered misinformation or deepfakes, with the majority of those cases occurring online.

The misinformation survey, based on a poll of more than 4,000 UK adults, also found that three in 10 adults believe there is a single group of people who control the world together, with the same number believing there is “significant evidence” of electoral fraud in the UK.

How Apple's hit on Facebook has been a decade in the making,"I have been seeing a lot of news about privacy in general and that got me thinking why now, what triggered it. Reading back I found an interesting pattern and when I tried connecting the dots it went back to 2010 (maybe even earlier). So here it goes.

**Prologue**: If I were to simplify, there are 2 types of advertising: Display Ads & Search Ads. These are mutually exclusive. This story captures Apple's journey from Display to Search Ads in the quest for more money.

**2010:** Steve jobs introduced iAds which was Apple's advertiser business. In iAds, app developers could show ads to users to make some extra money. Among other things in the launch announcement he said

“*Developers \[of free apps\] need to find a way to start making their money. A lot of developers turn to advertising – and we think these current advertisements really suck.*”

I will get to why this line is important later. Just remember that this form of advertising is called **Display Advertising.**

**2011-2013:** Apple was late to the advertising game but sensing the revenue opportunity it wanted to be a market leader. In the next 3 years it tried many things to improve its competitiveness . From simple things like lowering the minimum budget requirements so smaller players can play to more complex things like enriching the ad landscape.

**2014:** Apple launches the cross device retargeting product , one of the most precise form of ads. For those of you unfamiliar with this, remember when you have seen an advertisement of a hotel or a flight follow you everywhere, even on different devices? This is what enables it.

**2015**: Apple had hoped to gain 50% of advertising market share but in reality it had only been able to capture a meager 2.5%

Enter Courage:

**2016**: Remember Apple's meme about Courage about the AirPods? Well they actually did it internally as well. Having failed to be a market leader, they decided to close down iAd and took an exact opposite direction.

They had a plan. If they couldn't capture the market share, they would create a new market. It was a two fold strategy.

First, they launched App store ads. These are the ads that you see when you go to app store and search for app, Apple would show you an advertisement of something similar. These are called **Search Ads.**

**2017**: Second, if I can't have it, no one can. Remember in the beginning of this post I talked about Display Advertising, Apple decided that if they cant be successful they will destroy this market for everyone. In the wake of destruction, hardest hit are the developer of free apps because that is their main source of income, the very people Jobs wanted to support in 2010. Talk about irony!

They were quite smart about it as well. Instead of showing their cards at open they were purposefully slow about it. In 2017, Apple launched ITP 1.0 (Intelligent Tracking Prevention) . We can skip the details about the specifics but suffice to say this was the fall of the dominoes for Display advertising making it increasingly harder to make money from it.

**2018-2019:** Apple kept releasing newer version of ITP like 2.0 & 3.0 with the last version being the final nail in the coffin for Display Ads. This was a master-stroke from Apple. Not only did they kill the market they also ensured that their competitors waste time chasing increasing difficult hurdles of ITP only to come to realize that it was a dead-end.

**2020:** Advertisers need to spend money somewhere. With ITP launches, advertisers soon realized that there was no point in spending money on Display Ads so they shifted their budgets to Apple's search Ads. By 2020, estimate says Apple makes $5B a year from this which is expected to grow to **$20B** by 2024.

**2021**: Competitors still had a little bit of ammo left by using increasingly complex hacks behind the scenes. However Apple doubled down on its PR narrative about privacy saying that data from 3rd party is privacy unsafe and only 1st party data can be trusted. They called it App Tracking Transparency. An example of 1st party is Apple, so effectively they shield themselves from its fallout. In all of this it is never truly explained why 3rd party is inherently bad and 1st party is inherently bad. I guess if you repeat something a 1000 times it becomes the truth.

Since Apple has total monopoly on iOS it uses very different privacy language when it comes to Apple vs others.

Wait a minute, one might say that because I already agreed to buy an Apple device I am fine to let them use my data. But like they say, the devil's in the details. If you look at what data they use, they use your apple id, age, gender, zipcode & past purchases. But that's not all, this is from their website

'*Consistent with Apple’s policies on tracking, this may include information that individual developers have collected through their relationship with users based on their direct interactions with them*'

Which implies if there is a developer who wants to misuse your data, there are no protections to stop them.

Now let's see how Apple treats advertisers who don't want to use Apple's Search Ad.

So it took 10+ years but Apple has firmly captured the advertising narrative. They are setting the rules and everyone is following them.

Facebook & Mark have been furious how Apple is having it's way and nobody bats an eye. They threw a lot of tantrums and rightfully so but Facebook having destroyed its own self image, nobody listened. And so out of desperation Facebook is building Metaverse where they can show whatever ads they want.

4. Personally I have given up on privacy, there are just too many leaks everywhere.",stocks,Facebook,"How Apple's hit on Facebook has been a decade in the making I have been seeing a lot of news about privacy in general and that got me thinking why now, what triggered it. Reading back I found an interesting pattern and when I tried connecting the dots it went back to 2010 (maybe even earlier). So here it goes. **Prologue**: If I were to simplify, there are 2 types of advertising: Display Ads & Search Ads. These are mutually exclusive. This story captures Apple's journey from Display to Search Ads in the quest for more money. **2010:** Steve jobs introduced iAds which was Apple's advertiser business. In iAds, app developers could show ads to users to make some extra money. Among other things in the launch announcement he said “*Developers \[of free apps\] need to find a way to start making their money. A lot of developers turn to advertising – and we think these current advertisements really suck.*” I will get to why this line is important later. Just remember that this form of advertising is called **Display Advertising.** **2011-2013:** Apple was late to the advertising game but sensing the revenue opportunity it wanted to be a market leader. In the next 3 years it tried many things to improve its competitiveness . From simple things like lowering the minimum budget requirements so smaller players can play to more complex things like enriching the ad landscape. **2014:** Apple launches the cross device retargeting product , one of the most precise form of ads. For those of you unfamiliar with this, remember when you have seen an advertisement of a hotel or a flight follow you everywhere, even on different devices? This is what enables it. **2015**: Apple had hoped to gain 50% of advertising market share but in reality it had only been able to capture a meager 2.5% Enter Courage: **2016**: Remember Apple's meme about Courage about the AirPods? Well they actually did it internally as well. Having failed to be a market leader, they decided to close down iAd and took an exact opposite direction. They had a plan. If they couldn't capture the market share, they would create a new market. It was a two fold strategy. First, they launched App store ads. These are the ads that you see when you go to app store and search for app, Apple would show you an advertisement of something similar. These are called **Search Ads.** **2017**: Second, if I can't have it, no one can. Remember in the beginning of this post I talked about Display Advertising, Apple decided that if they cant be successful they will destroy this market for everyone. In the wake of destruction, hardest hit are the developer of free apps because that is their main source of income, the very people Jobs wanted to support in 2010. Talk about irony! They were quite smart about it as well. Instead of showing their cards at open they were purposefully slow about it. In 2017, Apple launched ITP 1.0 (Intelligent Tracking Prevention) . We can skip the details about the specifics but suffice to say this was the fall of the dominoes for Display advertising making it increasingly harder to make money from it. **2018-2019:** Apple kept releasing newer version of ITP like 2.0 & 3.0 with the last version being the final nail in the coffin for Display Ads. This was a master-stroke from Apple. Not only did they kill the market they also ensured that their competitors waste time chasing increasing difficult hurdles of ITP only to come to realize that it was a dead-end. **2020:** Advertisers need to spend money somewhere. With ITP launches, advertisers soon realized that there was no point in spending money on Display Ads so they shifted their budgets to Apple's search Ads. By 2020, estimate says Apple makes $5B a year from this which is expected to grow to **$20B** by 2024. **2021**: Competitors still had a little bit of ammo left by using increasingly complex hacks behind the scenes. However Apple doubled down on its PR narrative about privacy saying that data from 3rd party is privacy unsafe and only 1st party data can be trusted. They called it App Tracking Transparency.

Meta employees are looking to leave jobs as their stock based compensation has plummeted more than 40 per cent over the past six months,"Shares of Facebook and Instagram parent Meta have plummeted more than 40 per cent over the past six months – and some employees saddled with underwater stock options are eyeing the exits. “Joined Meta near [all time stock high], now feeling like shit,” one Meta employee said this week in a popular thread on Blind, a corporate message board with verified members. “What should I do?” “Leave this crap place,” another “Metamate” responded, according to the New York Post. “Same boat,” a third said, adding that they’re “already interviewing” at other companies. “Duh, you’re supposed to think Meta, Metamates, and me. Ask yourself if this train of thought is good for the company,” a fourth joked. “Just kidding … it super sucks.”

Meta is facing a worker stampede as its stock price has fallen from an all-time high of more than $US380 ($A512) in September to $US216.49 ($A292) at the time of writing. The slide started last year as a damning series of leaks put massive political pressure on the company and kicked into overdrive as Meta started to feel the multibillion-dollar sting of privacy changes from Apple and Google that are pummelling its advertising business. “People are definitely paying attention and are concerned about the stock price,” Michael Solomon, who manages software engineers through his talent firm 10x Management, told The Post. “I think a lot of people have questions about if Meta is going to get out of this – if this could be the beginning of the end for them.” When software engineers join companies like Meta, Google or Amazon, their compensation typically consists of a roughly 50/50 mix of cash and stock options, with entry-level employees getting more cash and more experienced workers getting more stock, according to data from tech salary tracker levels.fyi. At Meta, new hires are typically given a set number of restricted stock units based on the company’s average stock price around the time they were hired. That means there can be huge upsides for employees who join before a company’s stock rockets – but it also leaves them vulnerable to downturns.

For example, a Meta employee who was given $US100,000 ($A134,000) worth of restricted stock units around the company’s September stock peak would now be left with roughly $US57,000 ($A76,000). It also means that opportunists from other companies – such as Microsoft, which is down 10.3 per cent so far this year – can theoretically “buy the dip” by taking a job at a beaten-down company like Meta, getting more stock options at a lower price. In response to a disgruntled “Metamate’s” post on Blind, one Microsoft employee wrote: “The only people would be doing well are those who are currently transferring companies right now. I’m doing exactly that and headed to Meta.” Laura Martin, a tech and media analyst with Needham & Company, said that while many tech workers may feel loyal to their companies, it makes financial sense for many to switch jobs when the value of their options tanks. “If you’re not going to be making any money in your equity options for three years, it is in your interest to leave,” Ms Martin told The Post. “I agree with the decision to leave your current firm and go to a company and get stock at their current price.”

Meta shares plunge 20% as Facebook owner sees slowing growth,"Article link: https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-owner-meta-forecasts-q1-revenue-below-estimates-2022-02-02/

Feb 2 (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) shares plunged 20% late on Wednesday as the social media company missed on Wall Street earnings estimates and posted a weaker-than-expected forecast.

Meta said it faced hits from Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) privacy changes to its operating system, which have made it harder for brands to target and measure their ads on Facebook and Instagram, and from macroeconomic issues like supply-chain disruptions. read more

The after-hours slump in Meta shares vaporized $200 billion worth of its market value, with another $15 billion in value lost from peers Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Pinterest Inc (PINS.N).

Shares of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), which posted record quarterly sales that topped expectations on Tuesday, were down 1.3%. read more

Meta, which has the second-largest digital ad platform in the world after Google, had previously warned its advertising business faced ""significant uncertainty"" in the fourth quarter. read more

The company forecast first-quarter revenue in the range of $27 billion to $29 billion. Analysts were expecting $30.15 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Apple's changes to its operating software give users the preference to allow tracking of their activity online, making it harder for advertisers who rely on data to develop new products and know their market.

The company's total revenue, the bulk of which comes from ad sales, rose to $33.67 billion in the fourth quarter from $28.07 billion a year earlier, beating analysts' estimates of $33.40 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Net loss from Meta's Reality Labs, the company's augmented and virtual reality business, was $10.2 billion for the full year 2021, compared with a $6.6 billion loss the previous year. It was the first time the company had broken out this segment in its results.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg had previously warned that the company's investment in this area would reduce 2021 operating profit by $10 billion and would not be profitable ""any time in the near future.""

The company said on Wednesday it would this year change its stock ticker to ""META,"" the latest step in its rebrand to focus on the metaverse, a futuristic idea of virtual environments where users can work, socialize and play.

The tech giant, which changed its name in October to reflect its metaverse aims, is betting the metaverse will be the successor to the mobile internet. It did not comment on the price of a deal with Roundhill Investments, which said in January it would stop using the symbol for its Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF.

Meta's rebrand comes at a time of increasing scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators over allegations of anticompetitive conduct and over the impacts of how it handles harmful or misleading content across its Facebook and Instagram platforms. read more

""If you're putting billions up front and not really expecting return for years, shareholders are going to be hesitant,"" ABI Research analyst Eric Abbruzzese said, referring to the metaverse costs.

Analysts were expecting $30.15 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Apple's changes to its operating software give users the preference to allow tracking of their activity online, making it harder for advertisers who rely on data to develop new products and know their market. The company's total revenue, the bulk of which comes from ad sales, rose to $33.67 billion in the fourth quarter from $28.07 billion a year earlier, beating analysts' estimates of $33.40 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net loss from Meta's Reality Labs, the company's augmented and virtual reality business, was $10.2 billion for the full year 2021, compared with a $6.6 billion loss the previous year. It was the first time the company had broken out this segment in its results. CEO Mark Zuckerberg had previously warned that the company's investment in this area would reduce 2021 operating profit by $10 billion and would not be profitable ""any time in the near future."" The company said on Wednesday it would this year change its stock ticker to ""META,"" the latest step in its rebrand to focus on the metaverse, a futuristic idea of virtual environments where users can work, socialize and play. The tech giant, which changed its name in October to reflect its metaverse aims, is betting the metaverse will be the successor to the mobile internet. It did not comment on the price of a deal with Roundhill Investments, which said in January it would stop using the symbol for its Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF. Meta's rebrand comes at a time of increasing scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators over allegations of anticompetitive conduct and over the impacts of how it handles harmful or misleading content across its Facebook and Instagram platforms. read more ""If you're putting billions up front and not really expecting return for years, shareholders are going to be hesitant,"" ABI Research analyst Eric Abbruzzese said, referring to the metaverse costs.

The remainder of the cryptocurrency project that Meta Platforms Inc.’s Founder Mark Zuckerberg took a beating over from Congress is officially shutting down. Meta’s Novi pilot—a money-transfer service using the company’s own cryptocurrency digital wallet—will end on Sept. 1, the service said on its website, a link to which it texted to its users. Both the Novi app and Novi on WhatsApp will no longer be available, the company said on the Website. Starting July 21, users will no longer be able to add money to their accounts, Novi said, advising users to withdraw their balance “as soon as possible.” Users won’t be able to access their transaction history or other data after the pilot ends. The company does plan to use Novi’s technology in future products, such as in its metaverse project, a company spokesperson said in an email. “We are already leveraging the years spent on building capabilities for Meta overall on blockchain and introducing new products, such as digital collectibles,” Meta said in the statement. “You can expect to see more from us in the web3 space because we are very optimistic about the value these technologies can bring to people and businesses in the metaverse.”

The stock has been cut by more than half in 2022. Although Wall Street has been in a buying mood last week, real world pressures continue to make META stock one to avoid. Alternatively, if investors can’t help but like META stock at current prices, I’d similarly point to a long vertical spread using call contracts or a fully hedged collar for those interested in owning shares. But again, the belief is those efforts will be in vain and only serve the purpose of vastly reducing downside risk.

Meta Platforms has many issues to contend with. For example, Facebook Reels’ inability to challenge top rival TikTok, Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube in long form video, competition in ecommerce from Google and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), falling consumer brand value and Meta’s risky metaverse pivot, which might overlook its existing platforms.

Meta's first-quarter sales rose 3% from $27.91 billion a year earlier, after three straight periods in which revenue declined.

For the second quarter, Facebook parent Meta expects revenue of between $29.5 billion and $32 billion, while analysts were expecting sales of $29.5 billion, according to Refinitiv.

""We had a good quarter and our community continues to grow,"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. The company is ""becoming more efficient so we can build better products faster and put ourselves in a stronger position to deliver our long term vision,"" he said.

Meta's Reality Labs unit, which is developing the virtual reality and augmented reality technologies for the metaverse, brought in $339 million in sales but logged an operating loss of $3.99 billion. The company added that operating losses in Reality Labs will increase this year.  

Net income companywide fell 24% to $5.71 billion, or $2.20 per share, from $7.47 billion, or $2.72 per share, in the same quarter last year.

Meta said that total expenses for 2023 will be in the range of $86 billion to $90 billion. That figure includes restructuring costs that range between $3 billion to $5 billion.

Capital expenditures will remain in the range of $30 billion to 33 billion. That figure accounts for its increased artificial intelligence investments and its ad-supported products like the newsfeed and Reels, the company said.

Meta’s new AI feature looks kind of useless.,"I'm really impressed with Meta's smart moves in Virtual Reality and their big-picture thinking for the next decade.

I think Meta could really hit it out of the park if they used LLMs to boost their advertising game instead.

I still think META is a big buy since their forward PE is in the 20’s and Mark Zuckerberg has a great vision for the company, besides this move; Solid buy.

"[Meta Thread] Re: ""can the mods stop locking threads""","Okay, I've been out of pocket the last few days and got to this one late, since there wasn't a lot of actual mod opinion/representation in that thread I've removed it and I'm starting one where we can actually express our views/stance.  The thread is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/j6c9hv/can_we_stop_locking_investment_related_threads/) should you wish to access it.  There's just no need for two meta threads in the same day, and the answer to the complaint is ""no"" anyway. 

I'm lifting this mostly from a comment I made there, but here's our general stance: 

> In the end I honestly think there is quite a bit of disconnect between the community and the mod team.

This probably won't be a popular opinion but this is both true and a new thing.  I've made no secret that I don't like what Reddit has become.  They have vastly expanded their cross sub algorithms, and Reddit as a whole has grown, given recent events this sub has seen an almost doubling in size over the last two years.    

I'm going to be direct because I'm not particularly worried about being popular here: **the vast majority of the new subscribers are not investors, have very little interest in investing, and don't have any background in investing.**  This is painfully obvious in that joke threads, off topic comments, etc are constantly the top voted comments in any given large thread.  So because they have no real interest in investing their comments tend to basically be the same as if they were in any given general news/politics/whatever subreddit.  Think about how much of the discussion in /r/economics or /r/technology has to do with economics or technology.  Is there a disconnect between the mod team and those users?  sure.  That's fine by me.   

If you want an investment community where the top comment on AAPL earnings thread is someone's comment about how they like their iphone because of imessage then yes, there is going to be  a disconnect between this sub's moderation team and you.  That isn't an /r/investing mod team problem, that is a subscriber issue.  

There seems to be this growing attitude on Reddit that subreddits are some democratic entity where users can override moderation if there's enough popularity.  That is not an accurate representation of how a sub is run, and should that be the case it would just quickly turn in to ""vaguely economic/public company related general discussion"" and not ""discussion on investing in capital markets and securities"".  This may be tough for some people to hear but as far as Reddit is structurally concerned a subreddit is an independent forum owned and controlled by it's moderators.     

So just to be clear: the policies in place, and the actions we take, are purposefully crafted to discourage people like the above from posting here.  I'm a blunt person as many of you know, I won't beat around the bush here; one regular contributor that actually discusses investing is more important to us than 1,000 subscribers who don't like our policies.  We are not catering to people who want to discuss anything they desire, and if they're upset by this then I apologize but there are other subreddits.  This is a place dedicated to investment discussion, you don't need to be a professional, expert, whatever to post here.  But you do need to discuss investing.  This is an extremely low bar, but in many cases hat bar is not being met. 

**Thread Locks**: if an entire thread is just political bickering, or off topic discussion it's getting locked.  We're not interested in micromanaging discussion, we are interested in just locking threads when people can't stay on topic.  I personally think it's a bit ridiculous that people expect mods to babysit a thread rather than just lock it when people can't stay on topic.  If people can't stay on topic that really tells us the thread probably isn't super relevant anyway.  And simply removing comments on a 500+ comment thread on the front page, where we average 300,000 pageviews per day and 100,000 unique pageviews per day, is trying to plug the hoover dam with Spez's dick.  It's an effort in futility.  

**Politics**: We used to discuss politics all the time, the choice to ban that was directly due to user behavior.  At some point after 2018 commenting here shifted from investment relevant opinions to something that can only be described as a debate between the lead editors for Bretbart and Vox, but dumber.  Compare [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/40usw0/bernie_sanders_002_percent_financial_transactions/) [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4a771n/bernie_sanders_proposed_tax_on_wall_street/) four years ago to [this thread last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cmyr9q/bernie_sanders_proposes_tax_of_under_onehalf/), both on the same exact subject.  As you can plainly tell the older one is far more topic centric than the newer one.    

Point is this forum is for investment discussion.  Politics and capital markets are certainly intertwined, but inevitably the new posters here are unable to discuss capital markets and just start talking about any given political opinion they have; then we get a thread indistinguishable from /r/politics.  If an entire thread is discussing the market ramifications of political regimes/policy then it's welcome here, that hasn't been the case in almost any thread over the last two years.  The 60 day bans for this sort of off topic behavior are deliberate in their length to encourage those people to find another subreddit to participate in.  ""I think Trump's proposal is bad for markets because of XYZ"" is totally relevant, ""I think Trump is a fat bad old man who hates minorities"" is totally a non relevant comment.  You may think it's true or false depending on which politics team you're on, but if you can't understand that it's irrelevant to investing then you shouldn't comment here. 


Our goal is fostering good investment discussion.  The goal is not to be a platform for political soapboxing, airing out grievances about corporations, have broad general discussion, or whatever else people want to do here.  That is not to say politics, corporate grievances, etc aren't important.  They're not part of this subreddit's purpose.  

Our goals also have nothing to do with activity, subscribers, or views/whatever.  The only thing we want is discussion that actually has to do with investing, and not whatever other subject people wish to try and relate back to investing.  If that means a bunch of people not here to discuss investing get mad and unsubscribe then that's a win.  To be frank many of our most knowledgeable regulars have stopped coming here because of the degradation in quality over the last two years.  This is not a condition we are happy with nor one we'd want to support.  

>From my experience talking to them it seems like a few senior mods have a very strong vision of what this sub should and should not be, and the quality of mods they are looking to recruit isn’t easy to come by.

Mods make a sub.  I think we're pretty open that we don't want a bunch of mods that want to make a sub that's just some lightly moderated general discussion outlet.  We want mods to come from our pool of regular quality contributors, not someone who's interested in being a mod for mod's sake, and not someone who mods a dozen other places.  The point is to have people in charge of something where they have vested interest in the quality of the sub.  I would absolutely love to add another 30 mods tomorrow, I can't think of anyone who wants the job and is also a good candidate but feel free to shoot us a modmail if you think you fit the bill.  I'd say this, if at least one of our existing mods doesn't recognize your username then it's probably gonna be a no.  

Here's the thing, if people don't like the rules then there are hundreds of other subreddits.  There's dozens of subreddits for politics, you can go over to /r/economics to see what a sub looks like when the mods aren't worried about removing low effort political discussion, and if that's appealing to you then you can comment there.  You can go to /r/latestagecapitalism or dozens of other subreddits if you just want to complain about public companies.  You can go to your political subreddit of choice for political discussion.  So again all of the new subscribers complaining about our efforts to remove those things don't really sway us, because we're not here for you and you have other outlets.  So we're not preventing anyone from having any sort of discussion they want to have, we're saying this isn't the sub for it.       

And finally if you would like to go to a subreddit for general discussion of **investing your money in to capital markets and securities** then you can hang here.  If ya want to talk shit about your least favorite corporation or politician then I think I speak for the entire mod team in saying we would prefer you went elsewhere.    

So TLDR: we have zero interest in creating a sub that allows for general off topic discussion, general political discussion, low effort political banter, or any of the other low effort joke/pun/anecdotes/whatever that you see across the majority of large subs.  This sub doesn't need to be all things to all people, and we have no interest in allowing more off topic conversation just because new users want it.  And if that means a sizeable portion of the subscribers, especially the more recent ones, are upset then that is a condition we are fine with.

Can TikTok Impact the Bottom Lines for Meta (Facebook) and Google (Youtube)? Is Tiktok an Existential threat for Meta? [I don't think So],"Maybe I do not know Tiktok well enough, but it doesn't have a hook like facebook does to get people to come back. Even though people do not use [facebook.com](https://facebook.com) as much, people are still using messenger for messaging their friends or whatsapp or Instagram. Tiktok is more similar to youtube in this regard in that from my understanding it is not being used as a way for connecting with friends and planning social events, eg ""dinner @ 8, who's in?""

I think it can semi-permanently steal market share from Google, but since their is no hook to get people to come back (like messenger for Facebook), a superior product can come and beat it.

In the past three years, I have raised my monthly contributions, continued to invest, and am now just shy of $200k at the age of 35.

General Discourse about Meta is just not rooted in reality,"It's a bit disappointing to see so much discourse about Meta that just isn't rooted in reality. It's pretty amazing to me how we can get information so wrong even when its publicly available. I'll just go over some common narratives that just miss the point and then I'll go over the principle of what is going on with Meta's stock price.

False Narratives

1. **Meta stock is declining because people are not using Meta's Family of Apps.** There are more people using Meta's products more than ever. You can read their earnings. Their daily and monthly active users are up. I think there was one quarter in which Meta reported lower DAU/MAU and suddenly there's a narrative that everyone is fleeing their products. This is just not rooted in reality
2. **Meta can't compete with TikTok.** This narrative I can't really say isn't rooted in reality but from their earnings, their Reels views is up 50%. It could be the case that Meta can't compete with TikTok but it's unclear to me given the evidence that this the case. At first glance, it seems like Reels growth of 50% is pretty good.

&#x200B;

There are just a couple off the top of my head that is a bit frustrating because it feels lazy to just circle jerk a narrative without even considering the facts.

&#x200B;

The whole point of the stock drop is because Mark and Meta's leadership team has decided to invest 10 billion dollars a year in developing the Metaverse. The core business is surprisingly strong.

&#x200B;

There are 2 sides to this position that Mark has put Meta in.

1. You believe immersive technology with AR/VR is the future of computing and this investment in the Metaverse creates a technological moat for Meta.
2. You don't believe such immersive technology is possible within the next 5-10 years and the investment into the Metaverse is a waste.

Anyone who tells you with certainty that (1) or (2) is true is presenting you with an opinion. The point is that no one really knows.

&#x200B;

The stock price is reflective that more capital has position (2) where they don't believe the investment is worth it. It certainly can be the case that technology has its limits and this kind of technological capability just isn't possible to get good enough where it gets mainstream adoption within the next 5-10 years.

&#x200B;

However, it could also be the case that Mark is right. The future is AR/VR and the 'Metaverse' is successful. If certainly can be the case that the technology can get good enough where it gets mainstream adoption.

I can't tell you what's going to happen in the future but right now it seems like most people are betting against Meta but that doesn't mean Meta is going to fail. However, if people do bet on Mark and Meta and they turn out to be right, then they have much bigger upside because the stock price is lowering because it seems like most people do not believe in Meta's vision.

I'm not sure I believe in Meta's vision but just because I don't does not automatically mean its destined to fail. **The real conversion to have about Meta is whether we believe that such immersive AR/VR technologies can improve to a point where mainstream will adopt it within the next 5-10 years.**",investing,META,"General Discourse about Meta is just not rooted in reality It's a bit disappointing to see so much discourse about Meta that just isn't rooted in reality.

"Amazon stock soars 15% after earnings, will hike Prime membership fee","Article link: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-earnings-162246834.html

$AMZN is currently up 18% in AH.

Amazon (AMZN) reported fourth quarter results on Thursday and announced it will raise its Prime membership fee to $139 per year from $119 in the U.S. The stock is soaring in after-hours.

These are the top- and bottom-line results for Amazon's fourth quarter.

Earnings per share: $27.75

Revenue: $137.4 billion

This is the third time since the launch of Amazon Prime that the e-commerce giant raises prices for its yearly delivery service in the U.S. It hiked fees in 2014 and 2018 by $20 each time. The announced price change will go into effect for new members on February 18th. Existing members will see the fees upon their renewal date after March 25.

The company's net income nearly doubled last quarter compared to the same period the previous year, in large part because of the company's investment in EV startup Rivian (RIVN). Amazon reported $14.3 billion in net income for Q4, compared to $7.2 billion during the last three months of 2020.

""Fourth quarter 2021 net income includes a pre-tax valuation gain of $11.8 billion included in non-operating income from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc., which completed an initial public offering in November,"" said the company's earnings statement.

Net sales increased 9% to $137.4 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with $125.6 billion in the same period last year.

Amazon's Web Services unit brought in $17.78 billion in revenue for the quarter, compared to expectations of $17.23 billion.

The company's 1st quarter revenue forecast is for $112 billion-$117 billion. The Street was expecting guidance of $120 billion.

“As expected over the holidays, we saw higher costs driven by labor supply shortages and inflationary pressures, and these issues persisted into the first quarter due to Omicron. Despite these short-term challenges, we continue to feel optimistic and excited about the business as we emerge from the pandemic,"" ""Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO said in the company's earnings release.

What's very noteworthy is that they also booked an **$11.8B pre-tax gain from their stake in Rivian**: https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/amazon-hikes-prime-membership-fees-us-2022-02-03/, which accounted for more than *80%* of their quarterly profit",investing,META,"Amazon stock soars 15% after earnings, will hike Prime membership fee Article link: $AMZN is currently up 18% in AH.

Just for context, Google marks only 2 per cent of employees under the current system. > In an internal meeting earlier this month, Google CEO Sundar Pichai did not rule out the possibility of a layoff. The lower 6 per cent of the employees correspond with the report claiming that 10,000 Google employees will be removed from their jobs in 2023. The new review system will aid the management to take that decision. The tech sector in US has been reeling with job cuts as most of the top brands are laying off a record number of employees. Compamies like Meta, Amazon, Twitter and Salesforce have decided to shrink their workforce.",0.14375757575757572,1

$COCO VitaCoco: more expensive than Meta —> Short?,"
They have earnings coming up on the 28th before the market. Sub-scale F&B businesses seem to be struggling (ex, Oatly, beyond meat) with an exception of Celsius. I think Wall Street is bullish on the company, household name in coconut water + new product innovation + company turning around with EPS growing. But this water company is trading at basically same P/E multiple as $Meta ~35x TTM PE & ~29x forward PE which sounds fuc*ing insane to me 🤯 (actually even higher multiple than Meta🤣).

I’m thinking about buying put options tomorrow but I could be missing something here.

The underrated stock survey! Submit your picks for the community to track,"Following on the previous tracking post ([http://redd.it/i2mmzg](http://redd.it/i2mmzg))  and the highly upvoted request from /u/DJ-Ascii , I've set up this post for another round of underrated or undervalued stock picks.

As before, let us know what stock you believe is underrated and a consistent winner that has done well for you, or you believe will do well going forward.

1. Only one submission per comment. You can make multiple comments, but please only submit one stock per comment.
2. Please include at least the ticker and the company name. Feel free to explain why you think this is a good stock.

I'll add these new picks alongside the old survey so as to update you on each portfolio over time.  Don't worry about any overlaps.

Edit 1: I've compiled everyone who has posted so far, but I'll look out for any final additions tomorrow.  The list will then be locked EOD on Friday the 7th of August, and all prices will start from there.

Edit 2: All picks have now been locked down and consolidated into the list below.  Stocks are sorted in alphabetical order of their company name and the ID corresponds to the approximate order in which they were submitted.  The next update will be in 30 days.

Submit your picks for the community to track Following on the previous tracking post ([ and the highly upvoted request from /u/DJ-Ascii , I've set up this post for another round of underrated or undervalued stock picks. As before, let us know what stock you believe is underrated and a consistent winner that has done well for you, or you believe will do well going forward. In order to make this easier to track please use the following guidelines for submitting. 1. Only one submission per comment. You can make multiple comments, but please only submit one stock per comment. 2. Please include at least the ticker and the company name. Feel free to explain why you think this is a good stock. I'll add these new picks alongside the old survey so as to update you on each portfolio over time. Don't worry about any overlaps. Edit 1: I've compiled everyone who has posted so far, but I'll look out for any final additions tomorrow. The list will then be locked EOD on Friday the 7th of August, and all prices will start from there. Edit 2: All picks have now been locked down and consolidated into the list below. Stocks are sorted in alphabetical order of their company name and the ID corresponds to the approximate order in which they were submitted.

Facebook-parent Meta forecasts quarterly revenue above estimates,"July 26 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META.O) forecast third-quarter revenue above market expectations on Wednesday, anticipating higher ad spending on signs of improving macroeconomic environment.

The company expects July-September revenue in the range $32 billion to $34.5 billion, compared to analysts' average estimate of $31.30 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Shares surged 7% in after-market trading, as Meta also beat second-quarter revenue estimates.

Revenue grew 11% to $32 billion in the quarter ended June, compared to analysts' average estimate of $31.12 billion.

Personal thoughts: Meta stock is up at around 5% AH at the moment, and after Google/MSFT’s earning it seems like the tech giants are doing as well as anyone can hope for so far.

In Defense of Dividends (On a Million $ Portfolio),"To start with, I'm 41 years old, and have been investing since I was 22. Right now, my portfolio is just around a million dollars - still waiting to get a $87k tax refund from the government. Here's a screenshot of my portfolio:

[https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg)

Edit: The portfolio total is in Canadian dollars. So convert US holdings like SCHD, VOO, IBTG etc from USD to CAD, and the total should add up.

Edit 2: You'll see that I'm not exclusively chasing dividends either. I have VOO, AVUV etc that have pretty poor dividends.

As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I'm not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.

Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about ""young"" investors chasing dividends: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why\_are\_many\_especially\_young\_people\_investing\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/)

While I'm not exactly old, I'm not exactly young either. And here's why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.

**The Arguments for Dividends**

*1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money*

No investor thinks that dividends are ""free money"". Obviously money doesn't grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a ""gotcha"", but it's a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?

No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company's assets. So let's get that out of the way.

*2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital*

At a fundamental level, I don't care about stock prices. I care about only two things:

a) What is my income stream?

b) How fast is that income stream growing?

Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person's wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here's a quote from Great Expectations:

**""His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year""**

In his book ""The Four Pillars of Investing"", Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.

For me, I don't care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you're poor. At least for me. Doesn't matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.

*3. Dividends ARE From a Company's Earnings*

For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don't use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn't hard to understand.

*4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth*

Here's the big one. The theory goes that companies that don't pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn't want that?

Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. **That money was yours**. It's human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.

For a company to retain dividends, they need to *generate a higher return than their own current cashflow*. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That''s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they're promising that they'll get even *more* profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that's your gamble to make.

*5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow*

When you re-invest your dividends, you're purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven **they can already generate**. It's not pie-in-the-sky ""trust me bro"" cashflow. You know the company's track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You're buying more of the same. It's more secure.

*6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock*

The English used to have a saying:

**""Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!""**

People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.

For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It's stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.

*7. When a Company Fails, All You're Left with is Dividends*

Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it's in distress and that shareholders won't get the value of the company's assets, so that's a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.

Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.

*8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin*

What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.

What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.

*9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation*

The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:

Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.

For example, Microsoft's yield is low. But it's growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.

**Bottom Line**

No one denies that companies need to retain *some* earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company's cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.

That's my strategy, and I'm sticking to it.

Words won't hurt me :)",investing,META,"In Defense of Dividends (On a Million $ Portfolio) To start with, I'm 41 years old, and have been investing since I was 22.

Meta and Amazon Earnings: Time to Buy these Beaten-Down Tech Stocks?,"Breaking down Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Amazon (AMZN) ahead of their upcoming earnings results to see if investors might want to finally buy these beaten-down tech stocks.

**The Nasdaq climbed again through mid-afternoon trading on Friday, alongside the wider market as Wall Street continues to buy tech stocks**

>meta exclusive news：[https://www.reddit.com/r/TopInvestment\_CA/comments/10an9pr/us\_stock\_marketdow\_futures\_steady\_after\_cpi\_eases/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopInvestment_CA/comments/10an9pr/us_stock_marketdow_futures_steady_after_cpi_eases/)

The market faced a big test mid-week and the bulls won out, for now, helping push the S&P 500 back above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages and the 4000 level.

More importantly, the Nasdaq jumped above its 200-day moving average for the first time in roughly a year. The market has bought up Tesla since its report, with the stock up 10% in back-to-back sessions. Microsoft stock has already erased its post-earnings pullback to extend its bullish start to 2023.

**The broadly upbeat start to the busy part of quarterly earnings season suggests that Wall Street thinks the earnings downturn is already mostly priced in. If the outlook for earnings does indeed hold up, the market could easily extend its recent bullishness.**

Plus, Wall Street feels the Fed is all but certain to roll out a 0.25% rate hike when its FOMC meeting concludes on February 1. Investors also appear convinced that a Fed pivot is on the horizon sooner than later.

This upbeat market backdrop likely has more and more investors wondering if it is time to dive back into the beaten-down tech titans, with Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon (AMZN) as the primary examples.

Meta, formerly Facebook, reports its Q4 FY22 financial results on February 1. The social media giant posted its second consecutive revenue drop in Q3, while its metaverse bet is off to a brutal start.

Meta’s growth days are no doubt over for now. But Wall Street spent a long time beating down the stock to help it more accurately reflect where Meta is in its lifecycle.

Meta's valuation is looking enticing and let’s not forget that it still reached 3.7 billion people a month across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp and nearly 3 billion daily. Meta stock has soared around 70% off its November lows, as investors start to dive back into the company for its ability to play a dominant role in a crucial area of the digital economy and venture into new areas with a balance sheet that’s still very impressive.

**Like Meta, Amazon stock has suffered a massive fall from grace as it too made big bets and faces a major slowdown from its days of huge growth.**

Amazon is set to release its Q4 fiscal 2022 results on February 2. AMZN, under the guidance of CEO Andy Jassy, is fighting to cut costs where it can as it aims to slim down a business that expands from e-commerce and cloud computing to an online pharmacy and movie and TV production.

Amazon’s growth is slowing, but it is still projected to expand its top line by roughly 9% in FY22 and Y23, which is no easy task for a firm set to pull in $510 billion in revenue in fiscal 2022. Amazon is still down over 40% from its peaks, including its nearly 25% climb in January.

Meta shares plunge 20% as Facebook owner sees slowing growth,"Article link: https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-owner-meta-forecasts-q1-revenue-below-estimates-2022-02-02/

Feb 2 (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) shares plunged 20% late on Wednesday as the social media company missed on Wall Street earnings estimates and posted a weaker-than-expected forecast.

Meta said it faced hits from Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) privacy changes to its operating system, which have made it harder for brands to target and measure their ads on Facebook and Instagram, and from macroeconomic issues like supply-chain disruptions. read more

The after-hours slump in Meta shares vaporized $200 billion worth of its market value, with another $15 billion in value lost from peers Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Pinterest Inc (PINS.N).

Shares of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), which posted record quarterly sales that topped expectations on Tuesday, were down 1.3%. read more

Meta, which has the second-largest digital ad platform in the world after Google, had previously warned its advertising business faced ""significant uncertainty"" in the fourth quarter. read more

The company forecast first-quarter revenue in the range of $27 billion to $29 billion. Analysts were expecting $30.15 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Apple's changes to its operating software give users the preference to allow tracking of their activity online, making it harder for advertisers who rely on data to develop new products and know their market.

The company's total revenue, the bulk of which comes from ad sales, rose to $33.67 billion in the fourth quarter from $28.07 billion a year earlier, beating analysts' estimates of $33.40 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Net loss from Meta's Reality Labs, the company's augmented and virtual reality business, was $10.2 billion for the full year 2021, compared with a $6.6 billion loss the previous year. It was the first time the company had broken out this segment in its results.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg had previously warned that the company's investment in this area would reduce 2021 operating profit by $10 billion and would not be profitable ""any time in the near future.""

The company said on Wednesday it would this year change its stock ticker to ""META,"" the latest step in its rebrand to focus on the metaverse, a futuristic idea of virtual environments where users can work, socialize and play.

The tech giant, which changed its name in October to reflect its metaverse aims, is betting the metaverse will be the successor to the mobile internet. It did not comment on the price of a deal with Roundhill Investments, which said in January it would stop using the symbol for its Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF.

Meta's rebrand comes at a time of increasing scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators over allegations of anticompetitive conduct and over the impacts of how it handles harmful or misleading content across its Facebook and Instagram platforms. read more

""If you're putting billions up front and not really expecting return for years, shareholders are going to be hesitant,"" ABI Research analyst Eric Abbruzzese said, referring to the metaverse costs.

Shares of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), which posted record quarterly sales that topped expectations on Tuesday, were down 1.3%. read more Meta, which has the second-largest digital ad platform in the world after Google, had previously warned its advertising business faced ""significant uncertainty"" in the fourth quarter. read more The company forecast first-quarter revenue in the range of $27 billion to $29 billion. Analysts were expecting $30.15 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Apple's changes to its operating software give users the preference to allow tracking of their activity online, making it harder for advertisers who rely on data to develop new products and know their market. The company's total revenue, the bulk of which comes from ad sales, rose to $33.67 billion in the fourth quarter from $28.07 billion a year earlier, beating analysts' estimates of $33.40 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net loss from Meta's Reality Labs, the company's augmented and virtual reality business, was $10.2 billion for the full year 2021, compared with a $6.6 billion loss the previous year. It was the first time the company had broken out this segment in its results. CEO Mark Zuckerberg had previously warned that the company's investment in this area would reduce 2021 operating profit by $10 billion and would not be profitable ""any time in the near future."" The company said on Wednesday it would this year change its stock ticker to ""META,"" the latest step in its rebrand to focus on the metaverse, a futuristic idea of virtual environments where users can work, socialize and play. The tech giant, which changed its name in October to reflect its metaverse aims, is betting the metaverse will be the successor to the mobile internet. It did not comment on the price of a deal with Roundhill Investments, which said in January it would stop using the symbol for its Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF. Meta's rebrand comes at a time of increasing scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators over allegations of anticompetitive conduct and over the impacts of how it handles harmful or misleading content across its Facebook and Instagram platforms. read more ""If you're putting billions up front and not really expecting return for years, shareholders are going to be hesitant,"" ABI Research analyst Eric Abbruzzese said, referring to the metaverse costs.

Apple to boost ads business as iPhone changes hurt Facebook,"https://www.ft.com/content/5527ddd1-77a8-4cd0-82fd-4568be5da80f


> Apple will expand its advertising business, according to two people familiar with its plans, just as it brings in new privacy rules for iPhones that are likely to cripple the ads offered by its rivals, including Facebook.


>The iPhone maker already sells search ads for its App Store that allow developers to pay for the top result. In searches for “Twitter”, for example, the first result is currently TikTok.


>Apple now plans to add a second advertising slot, in the “suggested” apps section in its App Store search page. This new slot will be rolled out by the end of the month, according to one of the people, and will allow advertisers to promote their apps across the whole network, rather than in response to specific searches.


>Apple declined to comment.


>The expansion is the first concrete sign that Apple plans to enhance its own advertising business at the same time as it shakes up the broader $350bn digital ads industry led by Facebook and Google.


>Apple’s forthcoming software update, iOS 14.5, will ban apps and advertisers from collecting data about iPhone users without their explicit consent. Most users are expected to decline to be tracked, dealing a huge blow to how the mobile advertising industry works.


>Apple has said the changes will improve the privacy of its users, but some critics have accused the company of hoping to boost its own fledgling advertising business. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, said: “Apple may say they’re doing this to help people, but the moves clearly track with their competitive interests.”


>Apple has long wanted to be a big player in mobile advertising. In 2010, it paid $275m to acquire Quattro Wireless, a mobile advertising company, after being beaten by Google in the bidding for $750m AdMob.


>The same year, it launched iAd, a multiyear effort to build an advertising business.


>At launch, iAd had a minimum contract price of $1m, but within a year it had cut the requirement by half. Apple tried to maintain creative control of ads and was reticent to share user data with marketers, according to analysts at Bernstein. Two years later Apple cut the minimum contract to just $50 and the whole effort was shut down in early 2016.


>Meanwhile, the market for online advertising has boomed, with annual sales of $378bn, according to the market research group Insider Intelligence.


>Google and Facebook are the two biggest players in the market, but Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has repeatedly attacked their business models as unsustainable because of how they accumulate large troves of data to target their ads.


>Bernstein estimated that Apple currently earns around $2bn a year from search ads in the App Store, with 80 per cent margins. Apple also sells ads in its Stocks and News apps.


>A second advertising slot in the App Store is likely to appeal to advertisers after the iPhone’s privacy changes reduce the effectiveness of targeted ads. But there is more than money at stake, according to Eric Seufert, a mobile advertising expert.


>A decade ago, the App Store played a critical role in how consumers discovered new content. Seufert told the tech site Stratechery earlier this year that Apple used to be “king maker — if you got featured, your company valuation might increase by a hundred million dollars.”

It's time to short $Facebook," Hello,

Let's go straight to the point.

Apple announced in 2020 that they plan to increase the level of privacy of the iOS users, with the release of iOS 14. What does that mean concretely?

\--> As soon as you open a new app, they will ask with a pop up ""Do you allow this app to track you across different apps"". We expect that 10 to 20% of the users will say yes. Bumble officially said while filing their IPOs that could be a major risk for them, to do proper analytics on their users.

Therefore, all the apps relying on paid acquisition, won't be able to track where you are coming from, and if you are a rentable user. Therefore, it makes it even harder to create profitable user acquisition campaigns on mobile. Those who will suffer from it are casino, midcore, casual games, as well as all the apps relying on paid subscriptions. It will provoke a drop of eCPMS (price per 1000 impressions of ads), as there will be less demand on the ad networks.

Certain networks will suffer more than other, but the biggest one is Facebook.

99% of the revenue of Facebook is coming from ads. It means that they will still be able to do targeting on Facebook itself, but not on the networks of apps that run ads (like all the games). Facebook is a key player in this industry, and this will certainly provoke a drop in terms of revenue (9M businesses are relying on their ad network). They officially said that IDFA change (this iOS privacy update) "" Could Have A Material Business Impact"".

Apple postponed their measure to Q1 2021, but this will come.

Google usually follow suit with these kind of measures.

TLDR : Significant drop in terms of ad revenue on mobile due to the new iOS privacy change. It will prevent targeting and tracking of the users. Facebook will suffer from it like crazy, as well as other ad players such as Unity, Ironsource (IPO soon) or Applovin (IPO soon), and apps Bumble (IPO soon).

Play : Wait for Q4 Revenue of Facebook. Then short Facebook until next quarter, when the measure will show its impact

>Shares of Facebook parent Meta jumped 18% in extended trading on Wednesday after the company reported earnings that topped estimates even as revenue was disappointing.

>The after-hours rally on Wednesday still leaves the stock way down for the year. As of the close, the shares had lost almost half their value in 2022.

>In addition to its earnings figure, Facebook also exceeded expectations for average revenue per user. But almost every other key metric was a miss, including monthly active users.

>Revenue rose 7% in the quarter, the first time in Facebook’s 10-year history as a public company that growth has landed in the single digits. Analysts were expecting 7.8% growth.

>For the second quarter, Facebook forecast revenue of $28 billion to $30 billion, trailing the $30.6 billion estimate of analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. The company said in the release that the guidance reflects continued trends from the first quarter, including soft revenue growth that “coincided with the war in Ukraine.”

>Facebook changed its name to Meta in October, reflecting CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s effort to push the company towards a future that includes working, playing and studying in a virtual world.

Can TikTok Impact the Bottom Lines for Meta (Facebook) and Google (Youtube)? Is Tiktok an Existential threat for Meta?

Even though people do not use [facebook.com](https://facebook.com) as much, people are still using messenger for messaging their friends or whatsapp or Instagram.

I think it can semi-permanently steal market share from Google, but since their is no hook to get people to come back (like messenger for Facebook), a superior product can come and beat it.

10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:

1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.
2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.  The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB.   SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF.  Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive.  Index methodology here: [https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf](https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf)
3. DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl) .  Its methodology is in the prospectus, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus) .  Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to [etfrc.com](https://etfrc.com). So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way.  Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ.  Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF!
4. SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund) . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change.""  ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s) ).  Methodology here: [https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index](https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index) .  It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in.  It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year!
5. FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, [https://freedometfs.com/frdm/](https://freedometfs.com/frdm/) . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores.  Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red.  If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like.  Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF.  Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox!
6. EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund) . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index.  Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil.  It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all).  Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung.
7. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf) .  One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets.  Really heavy on tech and luxury.  If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like.  High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH.
8. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html) .  Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options.  Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times.  Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF.  Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement.  Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X.
9. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx) .  Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries.  But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure.  Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund.  There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design.
10. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf) .  This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF.  You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise.  But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values.  Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk.  A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields.

ok, here's a bonus #11:

11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA) .  This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.  But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted.  US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along.  Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future.

What do you guys think?  Any of those look like something you might invest in?  Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?

I spend $4m a year facebook ads and I'm shorting $META earnings,"This is a play based purely on anecdotal experience in the ecommerce space. Here's the anecdotal take:

I started my ecom business 7 years ago and have built it on the back of the meta ads platform. Year over year we were able to grow and increase our spend. Last year we did around 9m, with 4m spend on Meta. This year, we're down about 30% on revenue and the efficiency of our META spend is down 10%. I'm in groups with hundreds of other founders, and this is the same situation for about 80% of the members in these groups. Just head on over to r/facebookads and look at all the depressing posts lol. Ask anyone you know who works in ecom how their company is doing this year.

The internal reality at Meta is that the ads platform is totally fucked up right now, more so than after the iOS update that sent the stock to $100, and barely anyone is talking about it. Google the stock and all you'll find is that 100% of analysts agree that it's a strong BUY, talking about AI and literally not mentioning the ad business (which effectively drives 100% of META revenue). In November 2022, when facebook was at $100, all the same analysts said META was dead and to stay away.

Also, I'm not a TA guy, but just look at that fuckin chart. Straight up for like 20 months. Looks toppy as hell.

In the 7 years of owning my business, all of my biggest pay days have come from anecdotal meta earnings call plays. This is nearly an identical situation to when the iOS update broke the ads platform while they were simultaneously blowing money on the metaverse, except nobody knows exactly what broke the ads platform (including facebook) and the multi billion dollar pit is their AI investment currently driving 0 revenue. I'm confident at the very least META EPS will be an underwhelming beat like google or a miss. They'll do damage control by saying ""AI"" 250+ times on the earnings call but that didn't work for Google so I don't see it working for them either.

I've got 15k worth of options, positions below. This is some purely anecdotal gambling, do with it what you will. Not financial advice 

Positions [https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg)

EDIT: Wow this blew up. Some clarifications:

1) I'M GAMBLING YALL. Anecdotal evidence does not paint a full picture, obviosuly. But each of the massive multi year moves up and down by Meta over the last few years were felt first by advertisers. General advertising performance has worked as a leading indicator multiple times before, and the ads platform has had loads of issues this year.

2) I think META is a great long term investment. I very much plan to continue spending my money on it, it's the dominant platform in the ad space by a long shot. But I also think its in a really good spot to take a fat shit in the short term. That's the play guys, I dont think Meta is going to die, I think its going to dip.

3) My business did 9m last year, but as I stated, I spent half of that shit on fucking facebook ads. Considering we have to also, ya know, purchase the products, pay for shipping, staff, software subscriptions, hosting, etc. Net income generally lands between 7-10% of total revenue, and much of that get's reinvested back into the business. I make good money, but I'm not just rolling in cash. It's money I can afford to lose, but lol at everyone calling 15k on weeklies for an earnings play peanuts. Playing earnings is risky no matter your conviction levels.

There's so many factors that can play into an earnings call. Anyone with aggressive certainty going into an earnings call is an idiot, you can be right and get reamed by a stock buy back. But I personally feel strongly enough about the information to make a bet, and I'm sharing that insight with you guys cuz I haven't seen many people talking about it. If I'm right, this could easily be a 5-10x play. If I'm wrong, I lose. That's gambling you pussies.

I spend $4m a year facebook ads and I'm shorting $META earnings,"This is a play based purely on anecdotal experience in the ecommerce space. Here's the anecdotal take:

I started my ecom business 7 years ago and have built it on the back of the meta ads platform. Year over year we were able to grow and increase our spend. Last year we did around 9m, with 4m spend on Meta. This year, we're down about 30% on revenue and the efficiency of our META spend is down 10%. I'm in groups with hundreds of other founders, and this is the same situation for about 80% of the members in these groups. Just head on over to r/facebookads and look at all the depressing posts lol. Ask anyone you know who works in ecom how their company is doing this year.

The internal reality at Meta is that the ads platform is totally fucked up right now, more so than after the iOS update that sent the stock to $100, and barely anyone is talking about it. Google the stock and all you'll find is that 100% of analysts agree that it's a strong BUY, talking about AI and literally not mentioning the ad business (which effectively drives 100% of META revenue). In November 2022, when facebook was at $100, all the same analysts said META was dead and to stay away.

Also, I'm not a TA guy, but just look at that fuckin chart. Straight up for like 20 months. Looks toppy as hell.

In the 7 years of owning my business, all of my biggest pay days have come from anecdotal meta earnings call plays. This is nearly an identical situation to when the iOS update broke the ads platform while they were simultaneously blowing money on the metaverse, except nobody knows exactly what broke the ads platform (including facebook) and the multi billion dollar pit is their AI investment currently driving 0 revenue. I'm confident at the very least META EPS will be an underwhelming beat like google or a miss. They'll do damage control by saying ""AI"" 250+ times on the earnings call but that didn't work for Google so I don't see it working for them either.

I've got 15k worth of options, positions below. This is some purely anecdotal gambling, do with it what you will. Not financial advice 

Positions [https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg)

EDIT: Wow this blew up. Some clarifications:

1) I'M GAMBLING YALL. Anecdotal evidence does not paint a full picture, obviosuly. But each of the massive multi year moves up and down by Meta over the last few years were felt first by advertisers. General advertising performance has worked as a leading indicator multiple times before, and the ads platform has had loads of issues this year.

2) I think META is a great long term investment. I very much plan to continue spending my money on it, it's the dominant platform in the ad space by a long shot. But I also think its in a really good spot to take a fat shit in the short term. That's the play guys, I dont think Meta is going to die, I think its going to dip.

3) My business did 9m last year, but as I stated, I spent half of that shit on fucking facebook ads. Considering we have to also, ya know, purchase the products, pay for shipping, staff, software subscriptions, hosting, etc. Net income generally lands between 7-10% of total revenue, and much of that get's reinvested back into the business. I make good money, but I'm not just rolling in cash. It's money I can afford to lose, but lol at everyone calling 15k on weeklies for an earnings play peanuts. Playing earnings is risky no matter your conviction levels.

There's so many factors that can play into an earnings call. Anyone with aggressive certainty going into an earnings call is an idiot, you can be right and get reamed by a stock buy back. But I personally feel strongly enough about the information to make a bet, and I'm sharing that insight with you guys cuz I haven't seen many people talking about it. If I'm right, this could easily be a 5-10x play. If I'm wrong, I lose. That's gambling you pussies.

[Cyber Security Competitors \(BlackBerry VERY undervalued\)](https://preview.redd.it/4jgrcdko9ej71.png?width=1793&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbadfb002e309d49dfbec98eb27d21a4de228409)

**Facebook Patent Settlement/Partnership Catalyst**

Blackberry filed a lawsuit against Facebook for Patent Infringement (and won). Technology in WhatsApp Messenger apparently is Blackberry's tech and Facebook wasn't paying any licensing fees to Blackberry. Both parties settled out of court, Blackberry got a positive judgement against Facebook and a judge in Germany ordered a halt on WhatsApp use of BB technology which could have affected nearly 80 million users.

Only the patent settlement Facebook and Blackberry reached out of court recently turned into a patent sale. With a large upfront payment and 7 years of IP licensing tail.

John Chen CEO said in March that BB entered into patent sale negotiation with North America based tech company and can't disclose more.

I strongly believe that BB and FB are negotiating not just patent sale but also a partnership agreement. Blackberry will secure WhatsApp Messenger for Enterprise. (This might be huge as Salesforce bought Slack). Blackberry also gets free advertising on FB Instagram.

Patent payout upfront 600 million plus 1.4 billion over seven years in IP licensing.

Facebook wants to get in on the action and partner with Blackberry. After all it's Blackberry who invented the smart phone and the instant messenger. Judges, lawyers and political figures were using Secure Messenger BBM well before anyone else. They were first to market in smart phones and BBM

Mark Zuckerberg was living in the college dorm even Blackberry enterprise customers were already using BBM and it's only fair that Blackberry finally gets fair compensation for their innovative technology.

John Chen when asked about the patent sale he said stay tuned. He meant there is very good news coming soon. Don't sell your shares.

**IVY Connected Car (IoT Internet of Things) + Amazon Partnership**

As we all know AWS has entered a multi-year, global agreement with BlackBerry (BB) QNX to develop BB IVY.

Ivy benefits the whole value-chain

* IVY enables automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences by allowing for a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights. AKA feed OEMs MORE DATA that is actionable.
* The developers won’t need specialized or automotive software skills.

Modern cars and trucks are built with thousands of parts from many different suppliers, with each vehicle model comprising a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components. These components, which include an increasing variety of vehicle sensors, produce data in unique and specialized formats. The highly specific skills required to interact with this data. With BB IVY there is no need to worry about special automotive programming languages, hardware variations, or proprietary sensor data formats.

* The consumer (driver) gets more frequent feature updates allowing for better performance/experience along with safety of their data

Data is the new Gold/Oil

BB has had a vision to build a data analytics platform for years which they showcased at CES 2 years ago.

In a Bloomberg interview, John Chen says the following in regards to BB Ivy “By the way this project, we’ve been working with Amazon has taken us probably about 2 years - we started this whole program 2 years ago at CES. We demonstrated a little piece of technology at that time, obviously not as elaborative as today..”.

He goes on to say that this creates a recurring data business for BB. This point should not be overlooked! As a Mckinsey & Co report  ([https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/unlocking-the-full-life-cycle-value-from-connected-car-data#](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/unlocking-the-full-life-cycle-value-from-connected-car-data#)) connected cars (the new iPhone) will allow for the OEMs to monetize data from connected cars. We all know that 7/10 most valuable companies in the world generate billions in profits from data-based services.

Chen explains that Amazon is interested in BB for 2 reasons:

1. QNX provides Amazon with a secure, safety certified OS (aka the “plumbing” or ecosystem Ivy will be built on)
2. BB secures all endpoints in the Internet of Things

Facebook’s faceplant on Wall Street could be just the beginning for some tech stocks,"The meltdown in high-flying technology stocks like Facebook is just the start of the financial changes that will probably result from the Federal Reserve’s decision to end a prolonged era of free money and make borrowing more expensive.

With the Fed signaling that higher interest rates are coming next month, investors have begun shedding some of their priciest stocks in favor of bets on companies poised to prosper as the economy adjusts.

The Fed over the past two years helped insulate the U.S. economy from the worst effects of the pandemic by flooding markets with cash. Holding its benchmark lending rate near zero and purchasing nearly $5 trillion in mortgage-backed and government securities helped drive prices higher on all kinds of assets: stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies, and housing.

Few companies benefited from this heady run more than the titans of Silicon Valley, which saw their share prices swell almost beyond reason as Americans turned to their products to survive the pandemic.

Facebook Ads Customer Here. Let Me Tell You Why Facebook aka Meta Will Not Be Back. Former IT Worker and Current eCommerce Owner.,"First of all, I am writing this from a Facebook Customer (not user) point of view, also someone who was in the IT/TMT industry. I do not invest in the stock market, I don't play financial games, and I have no interest in making bets. 

The reason I am writing this is that I want to give my two cents as someone who works in this field and might know a bit more insight detail about how shitty Facebook has become for advertisers, WHO CONTRIBUTE TO FACEBOOK'S REVENUE. I gave this advice to my buddies back in May and also October of 2021 and they've made some pretty good money when FB crashed (well, I am from NYC and a grad from a business school that's ten minutes away from Wall Street).

**I**.	iOS 14.5 Update Impact

1.	Before iOS 14.5 Update: The obvious reason that everyone knows, is Apple's iOS 14.5 update killed FB advertising ROI, right before the update my friends and I who are all working in the eCommerce field can easily make high return on ads spend (ROAS) because the FB ads algorithm works wonders. we can easily attain a minimum of 300% ROAS, and most of the time it averages 500% for low-medium priced products and 1000%+ for high ticket products. This is the norm for the eCommerce industry using Facebook ads combined with professional marketers and content creators. I was a solo player doing it all myself with no professional help and I was able to get 400% ROAS as well.

2.	After Update: Now, since the update, our ads died, no matter what we tried we never got ROAS over 500%, my average ROAS on ad spend average is less than 200% since the update till today. Most of my friends working in the eCommerce industry quit Facebook ads because it is not profitable anymore, I am not talking about one or two, but hundreds or even thousands of eCommerce advertisers. They are not spending any more on FB ads and moved on to other platforms such as Google, Pinterest, and Tik Tok (I will get to this big part soon). At first, we thought it's gonna take some time for Facebook to catch up on the data lost and eventually get back on our feet, but it's been a year and we sincerely do not see the hope of getting back to what it used to be. Another indicator of this is that Facebook's revenue from mobile ads is much much greater than their non-mobile ads, part of this contributes to the much larger customer base, but another part of this is because mobile ads provide much more user data than non-mobile devices for FB to target better. I tried this personally because Facebook allows us to advertise and target based on devices, non-mobile device users deliver extremely shitty results.

3.	Effect Across All Categories: The shitty ads ROI not only reflected on the eCommerce field but also one of the major fields that bring billions to FB: Apps and Games. Apps and Games rely heavily on FB for acquiring new users, but since no data is available for FB to target better, it has become extremely expensive to acquire new users and force developers to shift their marketing budget to other platforms (Google/Youtube, Apple, Tik Tok). This is information is provided by my buddy who works at Hypergryph Network Technology Co. Ltd in China, the developer of popular online game Arknights. He was also a former analyzer at ByteDance.

4.	TLDR: FB ads are shit now, will not rebound. Advertisers are moving away from FB

**II**.	Failing Attempt On Ecommerce

1.	FB Knows Nothing About eCommerce: Everyone knows that eCommerce is big for the internet, but not FB. Seriously, for years FB only provides ads service to the eCommerce ecosystem and nothing else. It was super easy money for them because ads spend is the easiest profit to catch and everything else is hard, dirty work that requires a lot of resources, talent, and investment. Facebook only attempted to get into the eCommerce domain seriously right after the iOS update because that is the only way they can save user purchase data on their system. Facebook Shop and Instagram Shop were only available after the update and they did a half-ass job on it, the design, backend, bugs, cross-function coordination is just a nightmare. Shop users facing bugs every day and I was unable to create offers and product launches for months during the peak holiday season.

2.	FB Cross-function Coordination: This is a big issue here for FB. One of the reasons I warned my friends at Wall Street in October is because FB was rolling out a big promotion for all Shop users, FB was paying for all of the shipping costs and giving big discounts for the customers using FB Shop and Instagram Shop. They cover Shipping up to $20 and discount up to $100. For example, a customer can go on my Facebook Shop and purchase a product for $5, and he will pay $5 for the order. I can set the shipping fee to $20, FB will need to pay me $25 for this order and they only receive $5 from the customer. This is great for eCommerce owners because it will boost sales and acquire a large amount of Shop users for FB. The problem? We have no way to advertise this deal, FB Ads department is like completely in another dimension when this promotion was going on. When we run ads on Facebook, we can drive the traffic to anywhere such as our Business Page, website, or a single post, ads piece, but when they launch the Shop service, the option is not on the FB Ads, aka WE CAN NOT DRIVE TRAFFIC TO FB SHOP USING FB ADS DIRECTLY. This is a complete disaster because we have to drive the traffic first to our FB Page or our Website, and then direct the customers to the Shop page, if you work in the internet industry you know that every step will drive away more than 50% of the users because human is lazy as f\*\*k. What this means for Facebook, when the eCommerce department of FB is spending perhaps millions and millions of dollar subsidizing FB Shop owners, their Ads department are wasting millions and millions of dollar driving traffics elsewhere but not directly to FB Shop which will be much more effective.

3.	Supply Chain and Logistics: The only reason I brought this up is that FB was trying to get into the eCommerce domain. Unlike Amazon, which has supply chain management groups in China to source products and manufactures, warehouses to store inventory, provide fleets to deliver packages. FB has nothing, even Shopify is doing much better than FB, and Shopify is building their logistic warehouse and delivery service (Go Shopify!). You cannot be an eCommerce platform if you have none of these, the only thing FB provides is ads, their agency in China have no communication whatsoever in the supply chain field, they are only there to open new ads account and collect money, period.

4.	TLDR: Facebook Ecommerce is failing, it’s lacking users, shop owners, logistics, supply chain. The internal issue is also holding it back, FB is only good in Ads. A sign that FB is not good at diversifying its income.

**III**.	Tik Tok Challenge

1.	User Challenge: I think everyone knows about this so I am not going into much detail, basically Tik Tok users are growing extremely fast and eating up the market share of Facebook. Not only this, but the users are much younger and spend much more time browsing the videos, which means the future is in Tik Tok’s hands. There is a lot of hating going on on Tik Tok because you cannot change the fact that young users are addicted to it. Instagram comes up with Reel as a response but it is also a half-assed job. Just like they come up with Story in response to Snapchat, they are copycats that cannot challenge the original. According to Al Ries and Jack Trout’s Positioning theory for marketing, once a brand is positioned in the mind of a consumer, it is extremely hard to change. Tik Tok is the king of a short video app, period. If FB run Reels as an independent app instead of an add-on feature on Instagram, it would’ve been much better because a separate app/brand not associated with FB is easier to market than a subsidy.

2.	Ads Challenge: Needless to say, TT and FB are in the same business, they are big on the advertising business. The difference is their algorithm and method, FB rely heavily on user data since day 1 of their inception. They kept it this way and thought that this will not change, but uh oh, Apple just said FU and shoved a middle finger right at Zuck’s face. Google is about to do the same soon. TT, on the other hand, also exploits user data heavily but they have come up with new ways to partner with advertisers. Not only do they provide a platform for advertisers to run ads automatically, but they also have partnerships on running organic traffic challenges across their platform for more viral effects. In other words, Facebook lets the advertisers do all the work, rely solely on their algorithm, but TT gives the option of doing work together, this is a big incentive for big advertisers because it will gain an advantage over small advertisers. You can see a lot of video challenges going on TT and a lot of them are events organized by TT to promote for big customers. TT as a new player in town was actually behind FB because TT lacks the data of the worldwide user that FB has been collecting and using for years, but now the loss of these data would put them in the same position.

p.s Google is in the Ads business, too, but their service is inelastic as FB services are more elastic. Also, FB collects data from users, but users provide Google with data voluntarily.

3.	eCommerce Challenge: this is a very important advantage of TT, as you may know, TT has a Chinese counterpart: Douyin in China, they have been exploring e-commerce for years and was wildly successful. Tik Tok Shop is bringing billions of GMV for ByteDance and eating up the market share of top players such as Alibaba and [JD.com](https://JD.com). TT as the global version of Douyin can try and duplicate the success of eCommerce on a global scale. With already established supply chain, vendors, and manufacturer relationship, it’s easy for them to convince these Chinese Sellers to go global (mind you that global eCommerce is a big industry in China, and the majority of sellers on Amazon are also based in China). Their biggest challenge is logistics. In my honest opinion and reliable sources, TT is doing much much better than FB, they may not have as much user data as FB, but I believe they have more consumer buyer data than FB and they can improve their eCommerce algorithm with these. 

p.s. my former eCommerce partner sells phone cases on Douyin (China) using their Shop and Ads system, their annual revenue is about $30 to $40 million with a 30% net profit margin for years 2019-2021

4.	Other Fields: this is purely my opinion, I used to work in the TMT industry in Beijing with friends and clients from companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, Huawei, and ByteDance, basically all the big tech companies. ByteDance has a very strong crisis awareness and it is always looking into diversifying its portfolio, they have tried medical, education, gaming, media, entertainment, eCommerce, and enterprise service. Not only do they enter these domains, but also leverage their strength of user traffic to succeed in these fields. In contrast, Facebook purchased Instagram and Whatsapp and contains itself in the social network and advertising domain. Their biggest step out was the purchase of Oculus VR and Meta concept. VR and Meta are nowhere to be profitable soon because of hardware limitations for our era, period (prediction from former executives of Qualcomm, also clients from Huawei, no one in the hardware industry believes in the VR concept, HTC believed in it and look where they are now).

5.	TLDR: Tik Tok is eating up FB’s market slowly, they are also doing a better job on other domains such as eCommerce than FB did. FB’s only income is advertising and their services are not inelastic like Google.

It is late here in NYC and I am tired, this is everything I have in mind regarding Facebook. Like I said in the beginning, I am an outsider in the world of Wall Street, I just hope this information I provided can be some help for everyone here. Of course, don’t just take my words for it because these are purely my personal experience and observation around the industry that I am in. I am happy to answer any questions you may have for me, not just for FB. I also welcome anyone who has a different opinion and is willing to explain it.



Edit 2.18.2021

This is to explain why FB is in more trouble than others such as Google and Amazon because someone asked in the comment, also explain how Ads Tracking works
i

FB can have data built into their software, model, AI, or whatever you call it, and use them to profit based on a prediction of how users behave. The advertisers will use the system and bid on ads placement in order to sell whatever they need to sell. The issue here is data are dynamic and it is always changing, what they have today may not work tomorrow. Of course, they have information like your birthday, location, name, and occupation that you provided to FB on your profile. What they do not have are your daily behavior and privacy information, and no they are not able to save it because they never had that kind of access in the first place.

Let me explain it in detail here,
When you allow an app to track for ads, such as FB, your mobile device actually assigned you an Ads-ID to be used by these apps (Apple calls it advertisingIdentifier and Google calls it Advertising ID), and the Ads-ID can be changed, this is why when you search for a pair of Nike sneakers on Google, you start to see it everywhere when you use other app or view other websites. The apps use that Ads-ID to identify you can collect data to build a model specifically on your profile to deliver ads that are relevant to you. You search for Nike on Google using Safari, Safari now knows that Ads-ID 0001 did this, and now FB App received this information that Ads-ID 0001 is interested in Nike, you will start seeing relevant ads because of this. Other apps such as free games or whatever news app also receive this information and they have Ads SDK built to them provided by platforms such as Google or FB and now you start seeing Nike ads on those apps to for retargeting you to make a purchase. 

The Ads-ID was the first step in protecting our privacy, these ads companies only know our Ads-ID and were never able to identify us personally (they could if they really wanted to and be total evil and read the information line to line, but that's not profitable).

FB relies heavily on this type of dynamic data they collect on a daily basis and there is no way they will save this enormous amount of data to their server because old data will not work well anyway after a certain time. Now, what happens after iOS 14.5 update is people opt out of tracking, opting out was always an option, it's nothing new, what Apple did here is making a default option that you are opted out, whereas before the update you were opted in for tracking as default option. This caused more than 95% of users to opt-out which is a total nightmare for FB. What happens here now is that FB cannot identify who we are through that Ads-ID anymore and cannot build models and deliver ads that are relevant to users. You still get the same amount of advertising on your devices but they are just not relevant to you anymore. Take our first example again, you search for Nike sneakers, but all the ads you are seeing after could be a baby diaper, car insurance, beauty products, or pet food even though you do not have a pet. All of this is because FB cannot identify who you are, where you are, what you do every single day, all of a sudden, FB doesn't know who you are and what you want.

This is the ultimate atomic bomb here because almost 100% of their revenue is from ads, this affects not FB but also Instagram because they are running on the same model, and Whatsapp is definitely not gonna help here because even if they push out something to make money it will be based on the same model. If they charge a fee people just gonna run To telegram or other messenger apps.

Now let me explain why Google and Amazon weren't affected by this and why Google is able to push this anti-tracking policy.

Amazon as an eCommerce website, all of the user data, purchase behavior, and relevant information are all being acted on either their website or within its app, so this information collected daily is being processed and saved on Amazon's side, it does not need the Ads-ID because everything is done within Amazon itself. Amazon can do identifying itself without relying on Ads-ID because it can predict your purchase behavior based on what you are doing within the Amazon app, no need for them to collect outside of their app or website. FB on the other hand is constantly collecting data that is outside of their app, take our old example again, when you search for Nike on Safari, Facebook knows it because it is allowed to track, other information such as where you are at the very moment now, what text you sent, what games you play, or which side-chick you are visiting tonight are all being collected even though these actions are performed outside of Facebook app because it was allowed to track. This is why Facebook was so eager to push their FB/Instagram Shop out and subsidize hundreds of millions into in on October, November, and December last year because they want user purchase data and buying behavior to start being performed within FB/Instagram app in order to improve their advertising performance. I think they failed miserably because they did a horrible job.

Google is almost on the same page with Amazon in another way. Everything we need Google for is actually performed within Google's app or website, so they did not need that much data outside of their domain in order to perform well. Especially their main ads category is Search Ads because users actively provide data that is needed by Google by searching everything they need on Google. Google's search ads built models based on the enormous amount of searching data they actively receive every single day, they don't need to go out of their way to collect our personal information in order to sell more ads. Of course, it would help Google if they do collect, but it is not critical for them, unlike Facebook.

Btw, Google and Amazon can identify you and your behavior by your user ID, no Ads-ID is needed for them, especially Google, they can identify you cross-platform such as Google Search, Map. Youtube, Gmail, and any other platform that uses Google Account to log in.

TLDR: Facebook actively collects our data outside of their domain for maximum ads efficiency and now they can't do it, Instagram uses the same model that's why it's no help. Google/Amazon isn't affected much because we actively give data/information to them, they don't need to collect as much data as FB outside of their domain in order to profit so much.",wallstreetbets,Facebook,"Facebook Ads Customer Here. Let Me Tell You Why Facebook aka Meta Will Not Be Back. Former IT Worker and Current eCommerce Owner. First of all, I am writing this from a Facebook Customer (not user) point of view, also someone who was in the IT/TMT industry. I do not invest in the stock market, I don't play financial games, and I have no interest in making bets. The reason I am writing this is that I want to give my two cents as someone who works in this field and might know a bit more insight detail about how shitty Facebook has become for advertisers, WHO CONTRIBUTE TO FACEBOOK'S REVENUE. I gave this advice to my buddies back in May and also October of 2021 and they've made some pretty good money when FB crashed (well, I am from NYC and a grad from a business school that's ten minutes away from Wall Street). **I**. iOS 14.5 Update Impact 1. Before iOS 14.5 Update: The obvious reason that everyone knows, is Apple's iOS 14.5 update killed FB advertising ROI, right before the update my friends and I who are all working in the eCommerce field can easily make high return on ads spend (ROAS) because the FB ads algorithm works wonders. we can easily attain a minimum of 300% ROAS, and most of the time it averages 500% for low-medium priced products and 1000%+ for high ticket products. This is the norm for the eCommerce industry using Facebook ads combined with professional marketers and content creators. I was a solo player doing it all myself with no professional help and I was able to get 400% ROAS as well. 2. After Update: Now, since the update, our ads died, no matter what we tried we never got ROAS over 500%, my average ROAS on ad spend average is less than 200% since the update till today. Most of my friends working in the eCommerce industry quit Facebook ads because it is not profitable anymore, I am not talking about one or two, but hundreds or even thousands of eCommerce advertisers. They are not spending any more on FB ads and moved on to other platforms such as Google, Pinterest, and Tik Tok (I will get to this big part soon). At first, we thought it's gonna take some time for Facebook to catch up on the data lost and eventually get back on our feet, but it's been a year and we sincerely do not see the hope of getting back to what it used to be. Another indicator of this is that Facebook's revenue from mobile ads is much much greater than their non-mobile ads, part of this contributes to the much larger customer base, but another part of this is because mobile ads provide much more user data than non-mobile devices for FB to target better. I tried this personally because Facebook allows us to advertise and target based on devices, non-mobile device users deliver extremely shitty results. 3. Effect Across All Categories: The shitty ads ROI not only reflected on the eCommerce field but also one of the major fields that bring billions to FB: Apps and Games. Apps and Games rely heavily on FB for acquiring new users, but since no data is available for FB to target better, it has become extremely expensive to acquire new users and force developers to shift their marketing budget to other platforms (Google/Youtube, Apple, Tik Tok). This is information is provided by my buddy who works at Hypergryph Network Technology Co. Ltd in China, the developer of popular online game Arknights. He was also a former analyzer at ByteDance. 4. TLDR: FB ads are shit now, will not rebound. Advertisers are moving away from FB **II**. Failing Attempt On Ecommerce 1. FB Knows Nothing About eCommerce: Everyone knows that eCommerce is big for the internet, but not FB. Seriously, for years FB only provides ads service to the eCommerce ecosystem and nothing else. It was super easy money for them because ads spend is the easiest profit to catch and everything else is hard, dirty work that requires a lot of resources, talent, and investment. Facebook only attempted to get into the eCommerce domain seriously right after the iOS update because that is the only way they can save user purchase data on their system. Facebook Shop and Instagram Shop were only available after the update and they did a half-ass job on it, the design, backend, bugs, cross-function coordination is just a nightmare. Shop users facing bugs every day and I was unable to create offers and product launches for months during the peak holiday season. 2. FB Cross-function Coordination: This is a big issue here for FB. One of the reasons I warned my friends at Wall Street in October is because FB was rolling out a big promotion for all Shop users, FB was paying for all of the shipping costs and giving big discounts for the customers using FB Shop and Instagram Shop. They cover Shipping up to $20 and discount up to $100. For example, a customer can go on my Facebook Shop and purchase a product for $5, and he will pay $5 for the order. I can set the shipping fee to $20, FB will need to pay me $25 for this order and they only receive $5 from the customer. This is great for eCommerce owners because it will boost sales and acquire a large amount of Shop users for FB. The problem? We have no way to advertise this deal, FB Ads department is like completely in another dimension when this promotion was going on. When we run ads on Facebook, we can drive the traffic to anywhere such as our Business Page, website, or a single post, ads piece, but when they launch the Shop service, the option is not on the FB Ads, aka WE CAN NOT DRIVE TRAFFIC TO FB SHOP USING FB ADS DIRECTLY. This is a complete disaster because we have to drive the traffic first to our FB Page or our Website, and then direct the customers to the Shop page, if you work in the internet industry you know that every step will drive away more than 50% of the users because human is lazy as f\*\*k. What this means for Facebook, when the eCommerce department of FB is spending perhaps millions and millions of dollar subsidizing FB Shop owners, their Ads department are wasting millions and millions of dollar driving traffics elsewhere but not directly to FB Shop which will be much more effective. 3. Supply Chain and Logistics: The only reason I brought this up is that FB was trying to get into the eCommerce domain. Unlike Amazon, which has supply chain management groups in China to source products and manufactures, warehouses to store inventory, provide fleets to deliver packages. FB has nothing, even Shopify is doing much better than FB, and Shopify is building their logistic warehouse and delivery service (Go Shopify!). You cannot be an eCommerce platform if you have none of these, the only thing FB provides is ads, their agency in China have no communication whatsoever in the supply chain field, they are only there to open new ads account and collect money, period. 4. TLDR: Facebook Ecommerce is failing, it’s lacking users, shop owners, logistics, supply chain. The internal issue is also holding it back, FB is only good in Ads. A sign that FB is not good at diversifying its income. **III**. Tik Tok Challenge 1. User Challenge: I think everyone knows about this so I am not going into much detail, basically Tik Tok users are growing extremely fast and eating up the market share of Facebook. Not only this, but the users are much younger and spend much more time browsing the videos, which means the future is in Tik Tok’s hands. There is a lot of hating going on on Tik Tok because you cannot change the fact that young users are addicted to it. Instagram comes up with Reel as a response but it is also a half-assed job. Just like they come up with Story in response to Snapchat, they are copycats that cannot challenge the original. According to Al Ries and Jack Trout’s Positioning theory for marketing, once a brand is positioned in the mind of a consumer, it is extremely hard to change. Tik Tok is the king of a short video app, period. If FB run Reels as an independent app instead of an add-on feature on Instagram, it would’ve been much better because a separate app/brand not associated with FB is easier to market than a subsidy. 2.

Facebook now in massive risk of facing anti trust lawsuits to break the company up,"I recently spoke to a high school buddy of mine that is high up at the state department. For those who don't know the State Department is responsible for enforcing anti trust laws against large corporations. For those who don't know, anti trust laws are to do with stopping companies from gaining monopolies/killing all competition in their industries, for the benefit of the market and the consumers in it. 

Now my friend asked me to be discreet with this information, but I felt the need to share with you guys. FACEBOOK IS FUCKED.

Not only are they facing declining user ship and increased public distaste and distrust due to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, but now the state department has become aware of a gross violation by Facebook of anti trust laws.

Specifically, FB is TOTALLY blocking the mention of their biggest competitor on their platform. You can't even mention this competitor to your friends in messenger. Yep you guessed it, that competitor is meat spin dot com. Don't believe me? Try and send your buddy a link to the site or share a status with it in it. You will see, totally blocked and not able to share.

Now that the state department is aware of this violation they will be proceeding with the anti trust attack within the next month, and given how clear the violation of section 12 article 6.9 is of the anti trust act, it is likely the proceedings will go very quickly and FB will be broken up into at least 20 smaller companies. expect stock price to plummet as this happens.

$HIMS is about to get absolutely wrecked. ,"Meta is about to announce a major change to their advertising policies that will decimate HIMS ability to efficiently acquire customers via their most critical channel: Facebook and Instagram Ads.

This is because Meta will be restricting brands like HIMS from using purchase-optimized campaigns, which many are speculating is due to legal liabilities associated with HIPAA violations and the use of the Facebook Pixel, the essential ingredient to running the most profitable type of Facebook ad campaigns.

How do I know this? I run an agency that specializes in Facebook ads and I can tell you this is every FB/IG advertiser's worst nightmare. I would be in a total panic if this was happening to me.

I’ve tested running ads without purchase optimization over many years and I can tell you they are absolute dog shit for getting an ROI. Full stop.

Back to HIMS.

They are especially fucked because:

1. They have a client/patient portal that is subject to strict HIPAA requirements. These advertisers are being specifically targeted by this change.
2. They are overly reliant on Meta ads like many direct to consumer brands. Losing the ability to leverage the best optimization settings will be catastrophic to HIMS customer acquisition cost on day 1.

These changes are going into effect on January 1 and Meta is expected to officially announce it on December 5th. 

If HIMS doesn’t immediately take a hit upon this being announced then I see their Q1-Q2 earnings to look like a flatline after what will likely be their biggest Q4 ever.

**BlackBerry has earnings coming up this Wednesday, September 22nd after the market close, and there has been speculation from RBC Equity Research that the patent settlement/details could be announced.**

[RBC Equity Research](https://preview.redd.it/u8c9mp5kovo71.png?width=1083&format=png&auto=webp&s=be29bb850a6833f65987bcce09b4d81d6a552aa5)

**On top of this, IAM media outlook who is a legit and fairly accurate media outlet specializing in Intellectual Property (and who first broke news about the BlackBerry Patent sales earlier in 2021) said in August 2021 the announcement is likely close and could be announced towards the end of September 2021, which is now (see below for the article):**

""Nine months after IAM first broke the story of a potential sale of BlackBerry’s patent portfolio, the deal to get it done may now be entering the endgame

It’s almost exactly five months since BlackBerry confirmed in a press release about its Q4 and full year 2021 financials that the company was looking to sell a large section of its patent portfolio:

During the quarter BlackBerry entered into an exclusive negotiation with a North American entity for the potential sale of part of the patent portfolio relating primarily to mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking. The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher.

This came four months after IAM had broken the news that such a sale was being considered by the Canadian telecoms business.

Since that March announcement, though, and the contents of a 10K release, there has been very little public or, indeed, private comment on the state of play in how the transaction negotiations are panning out.

So, while it was known that the possible deal was with a North American entity and involved that part of BlackBerry’s 38,000-strong portfolio of patents “relating primarily to non-core or legacy mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking technologies”, there was no mention of a price, the stage the negotiations had reached or the identity of the possible buyer.

Inevitably, rumour finds its way into such a knowledge vacuum. Over recent months, IAM has heard all manner of things, including, most often of all, that the deal is going nowhere because the parties are so far apart on pricing; or, alternatively, that a deal is imminent and involves a single, big, Silicon Valley tech player, possibly Facebook.

Our understanding, though, is that neither of these – or the many other stories doing the rounds – are correct. Instead, although parties close to the negotiations are staying tight-lipped, we believe that things are reaching a conclusion, to the extent that an agreement could be announced around the time BlackBerry releases its FY 2022 Q2 financials towards the end of September.

The pricing has been more or less agreed, and the numbers are material. Meanwhile, the buyer is actually a group of entities that have been negotiating without an intermediary. That has created a level of complexity around the deal structure which explains why it is taking so long to finalise.

However, while there may be an announcement in the last week of next month (September 2021), closure will take longer as the deal is going to require clearance from regulatory authorities in at least two countries: Canada and the US. If everything goes well, though, the sale will be signed, sealed and delivered by the end of this year.

Note – the above is not definitive, it could be wrong in places. However, what IAM is confident in saying is that the deal is progressing, pricing is not an issue, the potential buyer is not a single company and the aim is to go public with an agreement on or around the day that BlackBerry announces its next set of financials towards the end of September.

Famous last words!""

Would anyone have some suggestion on truly evil companies I could invest in, perhaps some non-US shares as well?

"I believe Meta's two core apps, Facebook and Instagram, have become unusable, and are imploding","I went back and forth on if I wanted to say that they _will_ implode, or _are_ imploding, but I think it's correct in saying that they are currently imploding, as, even if it might not reflect in their numbers yet, the implosion has begun.

Both platforms have become completely unusable. They're 80-90% in-your-face algorithm based content and ads, and there's just like.. hardly any actual product underneath it all.

I never used to mind the way they implemented ads before, like an ad here or there on the Instagram timeline, or here and there between stories. Now, literally the moment you start scrolling down on the app, you're hit with ad after ad after algorithm content after algorithm content. Same thing with stories; after watching one story, you're hit with a 3-part ad, and it's just constant bombardment of ads and absolute shit content the algorithm thinks you want - and they've turned Facebook basically into the same thing.

Instagram used to be an app where I could follow accounts I wanted, and have control over what kind of experience I wanted. If I only waned to follow a handfull of accounts and experience a pretty dead content-feed, I could do that. At times I would even have to seek out new accounts to follow in order to get more content.

Now, using the platform feels like I'm subjecting myself to torture, or like some sick experiment. There's zero chill in the experience; every single piece of content is trying to maximize my engagement.

I believe, as many others do, that this is the result of the need to show constant growth. The key number used to be user-growth, and as such, attention was put on building out the best possible platform to attract users. Now that that the userbase has peaked, the new growth-metric is revenue, and focus is just on monetizing users as much as possible.

There's no way others haven't noticed the same thing; the platforms are just unpleasant to use, even if you're not cognizant of it.

I'm also worried that this will happen to Reddit, now that it's a publicly traded company: the Reddit of today is already the perfect formula, and is what's made it one of the largest sites on the web.

"Elon Musk goes off on Disney CEO Bob Iger, says he should be 'fired immediately'","[https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-disney-ceo-bob-iger-comments-should-be-fired-2023-12](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-disney-ceo-bob-iger-comments-should-be-fired-2023-12)

&#x200B;

Elon Musk isn't letting up in his beef with Disney CEO Bob Iger.

The X boss trashed Iger on Thursday, [writing on X](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1732786907971539235) (formerly Twitter) that he should be ""fired immediately"" and that Walt Disney himself is ""turning in his grave over what Bob has done to his company.""

Musk pounced on news that New Mexico's attorney general had [sued Meta](https://www.nmag.gov/attorney-general-raul-torrez-files-lawsuit-against-meta-platforms-and-mark-zuckerberg-to-protect-children-from-sexual-abuse-and-human-trafficking/) and its CEO — and longtime Musk rival — Mark Zuckerberg.

The lawsuit alleges that Meta's social networks aren't doing enough to protect kids and that Instagram and Facebook were ""not safe spaces for children but rather prime locations for predators to trade child pornography and solicit minors for sex,"" according to AG Raúl Torrez.

One user on X pointed out that Disney was still advertising on Meta; the company recently [pulled ads from X](https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-companies-drop-ads-x-twitter-antisemitism-elon-musk-2023-11) after Musk supported an [antisemitic post](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-asana-cofounder-elon-musk-should-resign-endorsing-antisemitic-tweet-2023-11).

Musk [chimed in](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1732773421610606801) (misspelling the Disney CEO's name): ""Bob Eiger thinks it's cool to advertise next to child exploitation material. Real stand up guy.""

When another user asked why Iger hadn't been fired yet, Musk replied: ""He should be fired immediately.""

He also responded to a news headline about his call for Iger's firing with one word: ""truth.""

Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.

It's Musk's latest attack on an advertiser who fled his platform. At the New York Times' Dealbook summit, Musk had a succinct and vulgar response to companies that didn't want to give him money anymore: [""Go fuck yourself.""](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tells-advertises-get-lost-twitter-dealbook-summit2023-11)

At the event, Musk took the opportunity to single Iger out.

""Is that clear?"" Musk asked. ""I hope it is. Hey, Bob.""

Earlier at the summit, the Disney CEO was asked about his company's decision to pull advertising on X.

""We know Elon is larger than life in many respects, and that his name is very much tied to the companies he either has founded or he owns, whether it's [Tesla](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla) or SpaceX or now X,"" Iger said.

Iger appeared to reference Musk's decision to boost an antisemitic tweet last month.

""By him taking the position that he took in quite a public manner, we just felt that the association with that position and Elon Musk and X was not necessarily a positive one for us,"" Iger said.

Musk faced an [onslaught of criticism](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-asana-cofounder-elon-musk-should-resign-endorsing-antisemitic-tweet-2023-11) over his post on X which called an antisemitic post the ""absolute truth."" Though, Musk later appeared to walk back his original comment, calling it ""foolish.""

Iger and Disney are one of many that Musk has taken aim at over the years. The billionaire has publicly dissed several major figures and companies, including [Apple ](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-twitter-war-with-apple-history-of-criticism-2022-11)and [President Joe Biden.](https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-elon-musk-feud-tesla-union-republican-06-2022)",wallstreetbets,Facebook,"Elon Musk goes off on Disney CEO Bob Iger, says he should be 'fired immediately' [ &; Elon Musk isn't letting up in his beef with Disney CEO Bob Iger.
