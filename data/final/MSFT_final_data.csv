Collaboration Alert: MSFT and OpenAI Launch $100 Billion Supercomputer Venture,"ARTICLE TLDR: Microsoft and OpenAI are reportedly collaborating on a massive data-center project estimated to cost up to $100 billion. The initiative includes the development of an artificial intelligence supercomputer named ""Stargate."" While the companies have not officially commented on the project, sources suggest that Microsoft will likely finance it. Stargate is anticipated to be operational by 2028, marking the final phase of OpenAI's AI upgrade. This U.S.-based supercomputer is part of a series of installations planned over the next six years. The projected cost of $100 billion has been attributed to conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft's initial cost estimates. The project is progressing through five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase, while Microsoft is concurrently working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI. The focus of the current phase is on procuring AI chips necessary for the subsequent phases.

Apple announces largest-ever $110 billion share buyback as iPhone sales drop 10% ,"Apple reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday that were slightly higher than Wall Street expectations, but showed overall revenue down 4%, and iPhone sales falling 10%. 

Apple announced that its board had authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest in the company’s history, and a 22% increase over last year’s $90 billion authorization.  

Here’s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates in the March quarter: 

EPS: $1.53 vs. $1.50 estimated 

Revenue: $90.75 billion vs. $90.01 billion estimated 

iPhone revenue: $45.96 billion vs. $46.00 billion estimated 

Mac revenue: $7.5 billion vs. $6.86 billion estimated 

iPad revenue: $5.6 billion vs. $5.91billion estimated 

Other Products revenue: $7.9 billion vs. $8.08 billion estimated 

Services revenue: $23.9 billion vs. $23.27 billion estimated 

Gross margin: 46.6% vs. 46.6% estimated 

Apple did not provide formal guidance, but Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that overall sales would “grow low single digits” during the June quarter.  

Apple posted $81.8 billion in revenue during the year-ago June quarter and LSEG analysts were looking for a forecast of $83.23 billion.  

Apple reported $23.64 billion in net income, a 2% decrease from $24.16 billion in the year-earlier period. Overall sales fell 4% in the March quarter. 

Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that year-over-year sales suffered from a difficult comparison to the year-ago period, when the company realized $5 billion in delayed iPhone 14 sales from Covid-based supply issues. 

“If you remove that $5 billion from last year’s results, we would have grown this quarter on a year-over-year basis,” Cook said. “And so that’s how we look at it internally from how the company is performing.” 

Apple said iPhone sales fell nearly 10% to $45.96 billion, suggesting weak demand for the current generation of iPhones, which were released in September. The sales were in-line with analyst estimates, and Cook said that without last year’s increased sales, iPhone revenue would have been flat.  

Mac sales were up 4% to $7.45 billion, but they are still below the segment’s high-water mark set in 2022. Cook said sales were driven by the company’s new MacBook Air models that were released with an upgraded M3 chip in March.  

Other Products, which is how Apple reports sales of its Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, was down 10% on an annual basis to $7.9 billion in revenue. 

During the quarter, Apple released its first new major product category in years, the Vision Pro virtual reality headset, but the $3500 device is expected to sell in low quantities, especially compared to Apple’s major product lines.  

“We’re only scratching the surface there so we couldn’t be more excited about our opportunity there,” Cook said. 

Apple has not released a new iPad since 2022, which is a drag on sales. Revenue for the division fell 17% to $5.6 billion. Apple is expected to announce new iPads on May 7 that could revive demand for the product line.  

Cook also said Apple has “big plans to announce” from an “AI point of view” during its iPad event next week as well as at the company’s annual developer conference in June.  

Services was a bright spot during the quarter. Sales rose 14.2% to $23.9 billion. That’s how Apple reports revenue from its subscription services, warranties, licensing deals with search engines, and payments. Apple has a broad definition of subscribers, which includes users subscribing to apps through Apple’s App Store, and said that it has over 1 billion paid subscriptions.  

Sales in Greater China, Apple’s third largest region, were off 8% to $17.8 billion in revenue, which was significantly better than the $15.25 billion in sales expected by FactSet analysts, potentially quelling investor worries that Apple may have been losing market share to local competitors such as Huawei.  

“I feel good about China, I think more about long term than to the next week or so,” Cook said. 

Cook told CNBC that iPhone sales grew in China during the quarter. “That may come as a surprise to some people,” Cook said.  

In addition to the buyback authorization, Apple said it would pay a 25 cent dividend, a one cent increase. Apple’s $110 billion buyback authorization is the largest-ever announced, ahead of Apple’s previous repurchases, according to data from Birinyi Associates.

If I sell I get the major tax hit (long-term gains) but I also know that taking gains/profits is not a bad thing, also considering we are at all-time highs in the market and at MSFT. What would you do? Sell it and just have it in a more diversified ETF like XLK? I can also collect cash on my 5.3% MMA while I invest weekly into XLK and a few other ETFs I have.",0.1659438775510204,1
NVDA OR MSFT for starting a long term portfolio.,"I have around $1000 to play with, I’m only 21 so I understand it’s not a lot to play with but I’d rather put the $1000 into one play for the time being and then focus on diversification later on when I have more money. 

I really like NVDA and I think they have an incredible future ahead of them but I’m very wary of their price at the moment. Buying right now probably won’t matter in 15 years as timing the market usually never works in anyones favor.

Microsoft stands out to me because they have a relatively nice dividend, especially for a tech stock, and I think they’re growing cloud computing, gaming, and software at a very fast rate. I think it’s price right now is pretty fair for the value that they offer but who knows I could be wrong.

To all of you who are red this year while the S&P500 is up 30%,"Lately I keep hearing the same old narrative from beat-down investors on r/stocks who are down YTD even when SPY is up 30%: ""everything is down this year, the indexes are just being propped up by mega-cap tech companies like AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA"".  They go on to say that just because they are down this year and indexes are up, it's actually not that bad because the mega-caps are hiding the true state of the market.

Well, let's look at the data shall we...

Here are the YTD gains of a whole bunch of indexes from all the industries that I could think of, most of which don't have many of the aforementioned mega-caps in it:

VGT: +32.99% (Technology)  
XLF: +34.87% (Financial)  
XLE: +47.15% (Energy)  
XLI: +22.38& (Industrials)

DBC: +43.37% (Commodities)  
PAVE: +37.90% (Infrastructure)  
AVUV: +42.18 (Small Cap Value)  
SCHD: +27.87% (Dividends)  
SMH: +43.21% (Semiconductors)  
ITA: +13.16% (Aerospace and Defense)  
TRVL: +6.82% (Travel)

As can be seen, every major sector of the market is green for the year.  Even travel and aerospace, two of the hardest hit sectors, are up YTD.  Every single other sector is up at least 20%.  It would take an objectively bad investment plan to pick only losers out of this sea of green.

So can we please stop with the BS that a handful of companies are propping up a dying market.  If you are down this year, you really need to review your investing decisions because you are almost certainly investing in companies with poor fundamentals that have been driven entirely by hype and/or trading options in a way that is pure gambling.  I just hope that you are taking the right lessons away from this year.  Please consider putting the majority of your money into broad market index funds.

Britain blocks Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard,"LONDON — Britain’s top competition regulator on Wednesday moved to block[ Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/)’s acquisition of video game publisher [Activision Blizzard](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ATVI/).

The  measure marks a major blow for the U.S. tech giant, as it seeks to  convince authorities that the deal will benefit competition.

Microsoft said it plans to appeal the decision.

The  U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said that it opposed the deal as  it raises competition concerns in the nascent cloud gaming market.

Microsoft  could make Activision’s games exclusive to its cloud gaming platform,  Xbox Game Pass, cuting off distribution to other key players in the  space, the CMA said.

Cloud gaming is a technology that enables  gamers to access games via companies’ remote servers — effectively  streaming a game like you would a movie on Netflix. The technology is  still in its infancy, but Microsoft is betting big on it becoming a  mainstream way of playing games.

Microsoft announced its intention to acquire Activision Blizzard in January 2022 for $69 billion, in [one of the biggest deals the video game industry has seen](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-buy-activision.html) to date.

Executives  at the Redmond, Washington-based technology giant believe the  acquisition will boost its efforts in gaming by adding lucrative  franchises like Call of Duty and Candy Crush Saga to its content  offerings.

However, some of Microsoft’s competitors contested the  deal, concerned it may give Microsoft a tight grip on the $200 billion  games market. Of particular concern was the prospect that Microsoft [may shut off distribution access to Activision’s popular Call of Duty franchise](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/09/16/microsoft-is-growing-tired-of-sonys-call-of-duty-complaints/?sh=bd568595ebb9) for certain platforms.

[Sony](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/6758.T-JP/), in particular, has voiced concern with Microsoft’s Activision purchase.  The Japanese gaming giant fears that Microsoft could make Call of Duty  exclusive to its Xbox consoles in the long run. 

 Microsoft sought to allay those concerns by offering Sony, [Nintendo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/7974.T-JP/), [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)

and other firms [10-year agreements](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/microsoft-says-it-will-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-for-10-years.html) to continue bringing Call of Duty to their respective gaming platforms.

Microsoft  argues it wouldn’t be financially beneficial to withhold Call of Duty  from PlayStation, Nintendo and other rivals given the licensing income  it generates from keeping the game available on their platforms.

Microsoft  President Brad Smith told CNBC last month that the company is offering  Sony the same agreement as it did Nintendo — to make Call of Duty  available on PlayStation at the same time as on Xbox, with the same  features. Sony still opposes the deal.

The CMA had raised concerns  with the potential for Microsoft to hinder competition in the nascent  cloud gaming market via its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, which  offers cloud gaming among its perks. Microsoft has committed to bring  new Call of Duty titles to Xbox Game Pass on day one of its release.

Cloud  gaming, or the ability to access games via PC or mobile devices over  the internet, is still in its infancy and requires a strong broadband  connection to work well. According to network intelligence firm  Sandvine, cloud gaming made up less than 1% of global internet traffic  in 2022.

Even with the CMA’s blessing, Microsoft will still need to convince other regulators not to block the deal. The EU [continues to probe the merger](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/microsoft-will-bring-xbox-games-to-nvidias-cloud-gaming-service.html) to assess whether it hurts competition, while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission [sued to block the deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/08/ftc-sues-to-block-microsofts-acquisition-of-game-giant-activision-blizzard.html) on antitrust grounds.

I haven’t counted it up, but it’s likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I’m up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I’d lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. 

These are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.

**Understand the Trading Environment**

One mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.

**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can’t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. 

In between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that’s more likely to pull back.  It’s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).

I try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly. Simply put, I buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule. Of course, I don’t do this if I expect a terrible earnings season. 

**Take Advantage of Sector Rotations**

The sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year. I do this by plotting sector ETFs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back. Professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside. If I run the P/E ratios for the sector ETFs, I can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over 30 P/E vs other sectors that are more modestly valued. Just keep in mind that certain sectors, like Tech, will always be valued more richly given their growth. So looking at P/E ratios is not apples to apples - it’s just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range.

Last year’s worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year. This is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high. I don’t bet against this trend, it’s been around longer than I have and will continue to be around long after I’m dirt. 

Last year you couldn’t give away a barrel of oil. Last week, oil reached $80 a barrel. 

One of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector ETFs that underperformed the previous year. I buy calls with expirations in 6-9 months, knowing that I will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100% gain. Sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year; other times it takes 9 months. So long as I don’t overpay for the options, it works. I don’t like to pay more than the average price return of the sector. For example, if the sector ETF averages a 10% annual return and the ETF price is $100, I’m not going to buy a call for more than $10. That way, if the sector only moves 5%, I can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough.

**Make The VIX Your Friend**

The VIX is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks. If the VIX goes up, the market is worried. If it goes down, the market is getting bullish. If it stays up, everyone is on edge. It’s hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button. So be careful buying during times when the VIX is high. On the flip side, if the market has pulled back and the VIX starts to retreat away from its highs, that makes for a good entry point. 

Another interesting phenomenon is when the VIX is higher than normal, there tends to be a selloff the Friday before a long weekend. This happens because investors don’t want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their Tuesday with losses piling up. I’ve found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day Friday, or to run some weekly puts on Thursday afternoon before the dips. 

**Selecting Trades & Investments**

**Have an Allocation Plan**

The first thing I recommend is determining, in advance, the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies. Anything shorter term is higher risk, higher reward. I break my portfolio in the following buckets:

* 25% long-term market investment using equity ETFs that largely track the SPX or do a breakdown between bonds and the market. I use Vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called CALF. I will not touch this money for 15+ years.
* 25% cash. I like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare. This way if a black swan event happens, I not only have money to invest, I have money to live on should things go bad for a while. This philosophy enabled me to buy options when COVID hit in 2020 without worrying if I could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job. It’s also very useful if I have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions. I took this from Buffet FWIW.
* 30% options, mostly in tax advantaged accounts (IRAs). I aim for a 50% annual return overall with this portfolio, though it fluctuates a lot year to year.
* 10% long term blue chips stocks like Visa, Apple, MSFT, etc. I defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them and/or buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur. That can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls. 
* 6% long-term bets in a Roth IRA. These are equities I think all have a chance at a 10X return but that will take 5-10 years. It’s a lot of IPOs, small tech companies, and biotechs. I have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of 40-50% on the belief that a few of the 30 in here will more than compensate for it. This is a new strategy for me so I’ll let you know in 10 years if it works.
* 3% leveraged hedges.These are puts on my own positions, stocks, or the market at large. Generally I use VIX calls, buy puts, occasionally buy calls on the SPXS, and run strangles on investments (betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts).  
* 1% in other things I can’t mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe.

**Use Technologies to Find Ideas**

Unless you want to spend 8 hours a day reading news or are OK getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends, you need to use tools to help you locate investment/trade ideas and be willing to pay for them. I value my time and am willing to pay .5% of my portfolio a year if it saves me time, and more if it generates higher returns. 

I’ve tried about a dozen or so services, including stock picking services like Fool and Investorsplace. Ultimately I decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because I did not want to wait 5 years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps. So I switched to analytics tools and my Fidelity platform. 

My favorite tools to use are Zack’s VGM score, Levelfields, and Fidelity. The Zack’s VGM measures a stock’s value, growth rate, and momentum. It’s an easy screen I can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at. The caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes the companies on the list get stale and have already moved 99% of the way they are going to move. So you need to keep an eye on what’s new to the list to avoid losing money. That part is crucial. 

The list usually represents companies that are well valued and poised to move up over the next 6-9 months. Warning: they can move very slowly so be patient and set your target exit to automatically exit. I use Fidelity to do my own due diligence on the stocks from there, examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down the price.

A friend recently turned me on to an AI tool called Levelfields. They have a lot of news alerts but only for the types of events that matter and are organized thematically. It helps me find trades on news events with high returns or get in early on the small to mid-cap companies you don’t usually hear about which fall between the cracks in the penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites. They often send alerts on company events before there’s any news out, which is really helpful. The interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen, so it’s easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success.   
I use it a lot for pinpointing entry/exit points from options trades and have bought stock in a few companies I hadn’t ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing it on revenue and earnings. Not sure why, but they never came up in any of my Fidelity stock screens. I suspect it’s because there’s a lag in the data Fidelity is getting from S&P but haven’t confirmed this. They send a lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that they’d have a better way to rank the stocks in the alerts so I didn’t have to look up the stocks on Fidelity.

I use Fidelity for basic news reading, running stock screens for high growth stocks at decent valuations, looking deeply at the history of earnings results, actually trading options, and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity.  I sell puts when I see abnormal call volume and run strangles if the stock is at a mid-point in its 52-week price range in case it shoots up and then down. I always set an automated exit.

Fidelity also has a cool probability calculator for options I use when selling puts. It tells you the probability of a stock falling below a certain range. I use that number to determine where to sell puts without a lot of risk. I do two standard deviations out and still buy a put with a lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like GME and TSLA. My typical goal is to make 800 a week from these plays which I use to fund new call positions.

**Be Wary of Analyst Opinions**

If you’ve invested actively for a while, you’ve likely noticed a peculiar trend: as a stock is cratering, analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it. This is not for your benefit. Brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts, so there is inherent bias in the system. 

I’ve also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings. They are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks. One study found less than 1% issued sell recommendations. What’s more, the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping. CNBC has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms (e.g. “Goldman Sachs says these 3 stocks are ready to explode”), but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline, they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right. 

I am embarrassed to say I lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if 4 analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect, which is tradable. But it boils down to needing to do your own research.

**Good Things Come in Pairs**

Just about every stock has a peer or competitor. Most have several. I stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders. I’ve owned Visa and Mastercard. I own OLO and TOST. I have a handful of, um, herbal medicine providers. I like ETSY and AMZN. If you bet on a small group of competitors, it’s likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially. 

Similarly, it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy. What do I mean? If Mastercard reports low cross border transactions, it’s highly probable Visa will be experiencing the same thing. So you can use the information from Mastercard to alter your position on Visa.

**Exercise Financial Discipline**

Even when I’ve been successful picking investments, I’ve run into problems with how to handle my successes. We’ve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go. That’s usually the moment I’ve learned I should be taking some gains. A few rules I try hard to follow but still screw up:

1. Take Profits Often.   
When an option or stock hits 100% return, I look to take some profit. It may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call, but it is. Just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return. You can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up. This ensures you cannot lose money. My rationale here is simple: at a 100% gain, I now have more to lose than I have to gain. You will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150% then down to -50% on the same positions, which makes me want to break things.  
If you find yourself up huge on an equity investment, switch to options. I did this for my BABA position and it saved me. When it hit 300, I was up 200%. I sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares. I had about 60K in stock and switched to something like 6K in options. When BABA crashed down to 150 I really didn’t care much. I was only down 4.5K instead of 30K. I had my profit of 40K locked in, so being down 4.5K was no big deal.  

2. Fail Fast.   
If the option price sinks to -50% in value, it’s likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to (praying is not a strategy). The other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as I wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date. If there’s negative news driving this, I’m out. I want to fail quickly. That allows me time to take the remaining 50% and generate gains with it on a better investment. I think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as I tend to be an optimist.  

3. Profit Both Ways.   
If a stock I hold hits an all-time high in price or valuation, I look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts. This enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave. I hold Visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings, I sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts. This offset a paper loss for me of \~20K yesterday alone by 7.5K in gains, which I secured as real profits. Assuming Visa will recover, that 7K adds 9% to this year’s returns for Visa.  

4. Be Patient but Not Greedy.   
I have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea, especially if using good tools. Asset managers, wealth managers, and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months, not daily, so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness. Example, I held Upstart from April to August this year and sold it because it was running flat. A couple weeks later the stock tripled. FML were the only words I could think of at the time. The second thought I had was that I should’ve bought just one call option to replace the stock I sold.  
On the flip side, once a stock does move a lot higher, don’t be greedy. What goes up fast can come down just as fast. I feel a lot worse watching a stock/option go up 200% then come down all the way or more than I do exiting with a 100% gain watching the stock go up more. Don’t chase the perfect trade. It’s a white whale. Just make money.  

5. Everyone Has a Plan Until You Get Punched in the Mouth.   
This is as true in boxing (thanks Mike) as it is investing. That’s why it’s essential to have a plan A and a plan B should plan A not work out as you thought. Waiting through it can work, but it isn’t a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment.   
So if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising COVID rates and COVID rates stop rising, I try to have plan B ready. I keep a lot of notes. I track every trade. I review what went wrong with trades quarterly. I learn. I avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest. I try not to fall in love with any stock. And I know that even if I lose 100K, there’s more money to be made in the coming years and decades if I stick it out.",stocks,MSFT,"I made $500,000 trading stocks and options in 18 months. These are the 15 things I did that worked best. I failed a lot while trading before, during, and after succeeding.

If the option price sinks to -50% in value, it’s likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to (praying is not a strategy). The other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as I wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date. If there’s negative news driving this, I’m out. I want to fail quickly. That allows me time to take the remaining 50% and generate gains with it on a better investment. I think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as I tend to be an optimist. 3. Profit Both Ways. If a stock I hold hits an all-time high in price or valuation, I look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts. This enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave. I hold Visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings, I sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts. This offset a paper loss for me of \~20K yesterday alone by 7.5K in gains, which I secured as real profits. Assuming Visa will recover, that 7K adds 9% to this year’s returns for Visa. 4. Be Patient but Not Greedy. I have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea, especially if using good tools. Asset managers, wealth managers, and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months, not daily, so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness. Example, I held Upstart from April to August this year and sold it because it was running flat. A couple weeks later the stock tripled. FML were the only words I could think of at the time. The second thought I had was that I should’ve bought just one call option to replace the stock I sold. On the flip side, once a stock does move a lot higher, don’t be greedy. What goes up fast can come down just as fast. I feel a lot worse watching a stock/option go up 200% then come down all the way or more than I do exiting with a 100% gain watching the stock go up more. Don’t chase the perfect trade. It’s a white whale. Just make money. 5. Everyone Has a Plan Until You Get Punched in the Mouth. This is as true in boxing (thanks Mike) as it is investing. That’s why it’s essential to have a plan A and a plan B should plan A not work out as you thought. Waiting through it can work, but it isn’t a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment. So if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising COVID rates and COVID rates stop rising, I try to have plan B ready. I keep a lot of notes. I track every trade. I review what went wrong with trades quarterly. I learn. I avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest. I try not to fall in love with any stock. And I know that even if I lose 100K, there’s more money to be made in the coming years and decades if I stick it out.",0.09161108062516513,1

"Apple hits 3 trillion market cap, becoming the first company to hit the mark","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-hits-3-trillion-market-cap-184825195.html

“Apple (AAPL) officially has a market capitalization of $3 trillion. The tech giant passed the $182.86 mark Monday, making it the first publicly traded company in history to hit such a market valuation. Shares were bouncing above and below the number during the day.

Apple’s rise to a $3 trillion market cap, which is based on its stock price, comes less than two years after its market cap hit $2 trillion. Microsoft (MSFT) is also potentially on its way to the $3 trillion mark after topping $2 trillion in June.

Apple’s rise to $3 trillion comes on the back of the incredible success of its iPhone line, which has spawned accessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods, not to mention services like AppleCare, the App Store, Apple Music+, and Apple TV+.

Apple’s latest generation of hardware has, however, been struck by the same supply chain issues affecting everything from car manufacturers to home appliance makers. According to Bloomberg, the company previously cut its iPhone production goal by 10 million units in October due to supply constraints.

And Nikkei Asia reports that Apple’s manufacturing partners in China were getting days off when they would normally be working full throttle to ramp up device availability for the holiday season.

Stay ahead of the market
But Apple has also shown off some major innovations in 2021 including the launch of its powerful M1 Pro and M1 Max chips for its MacBook Pro laptops. Those chips allow Apple to ditch Intel’s own processors, giving Apple far more control over design and performance.

And then there are reports about Apple’s future devices including the obvious updates to stalwarts like the iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods, as well as entirely new product categories like augmented reality and virtual reality headsets.

Apple’s rise to $3 trillion hasn’t been without controversy, however. The company has repeatedly been called out for its cooperation with the Chinese government including its censorship policies and its need to store user data there. Apple, however, says it “complies with the laws pertaining to local entities that control customer data and provides data as legally required.”

Like its Big Tech compatriots, Apple is also contending with antitrust issues. In August 2020, “Fortnite” maker Epic filed suit against Apple claiming it violates antitrust laws by requiring developers to use its in-app payment system, which automatically grants Apple a 30% fee for each purchase.

While the company largely came out of suit unscathed, the judge in the case has called on Apple to allow third-party app developers to add external purchasing options to their apps. Apple is appealing the ruling.

The company is also reportedly staring down the prospect of an antitrust battle with the Department of Justice, which is said to be preparing its own case against the iPhone maker. That would likely focus on Apple’s control of the iPhone and its iOS operating system.”",stocks,MSFT,"Apple hits 3 trillion market cap, becoming the first company to hit the mark “Apple (AAPL) officially has a market capitalization of $3 trillion.

What’s the stock you’ll never sell,"Our investment philosophy and goals usually depend on our age. You probably wouldn’t accept the same risk at 20 than at 60, especially if your stock portfolio is part of your retirement plan.

I agree with a value investing philosophy, so to me never selling implies the original investment thesis doesn’t change. 

I think we could have an interesting discussion if we share our age (or age range) and the company in which we trust for the rest of our lives (and why).

I’m in my 30s, so assuming I live for the next 50 years, I believe Lockheed Martin ($LMT) will remain an important player in the defense sector, as I expect war (mostly proxy wars) to continue being used for political interests and if the US DoD sees its budget reduced, our current Western society’s paradigm will be over.

Other candidates I’ve considered are Visa ($V), Microsoft ($MSFT) and Amazon ($AMZN), but I could see all those titans being disrupted someday in the next 50 years.

I think we could have an interesting discussion if we share our age (or age range) and the company in which we trust for the rest of our lives (and why). I’m in my 30s, so assuming I live for the next 50 years, I believe Lockheed Martin ($LMT) will remain an important player in the defense sector, as I expect war (mostly proxy wars) to continue being used for political interests and if the US DoD sees its budget reduced, our current Western society’s paradigm will be over.

Nvidia passes Microsoft in market cap to become most valuable public company ,"Nvidia, long known in the niche gaming community for its graphics chips, is now the most valuable public company in the world.

Shares of the chipmaker climbed 3.2% in mid-day trading on Tuesday, lifting the company’s market cap to $3.33 trillion, surpassing Microsoft. Earlier this month, Nvidia hit a $3 trillion market cap for the first time, and passed Apple.

Nvidia shares are up more than 170% so far this year, and took a leg higher after the company reported first-quarter earnings in May. The stock has multiplied by more than nine-fold since the end of 2022, a rise that’s coincided with the emergence of generative artificial intelligence.

Nvidia has about 80% of the market for AI chips used in data centers, a business that’s ballooned as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and others have raced to snap up the processors needed to build AI models and run increasingly large workloads.

For the most recent quarter, revenue in Nvidia’s data center business rose 427% from a year earlier to $22.6 billion, accounting for about 86% of the company’s total sales.

Founded in 1991, Nvidia spent its first few decades primarily as a hardware company that sold chips for gamers to run 3D titles. It’s also dabbled in cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud gaming subscriptions.

But over the past two years, Nvidia shares have skyrocketed as Wall Street came to recognize the company’s technology as the engine behind an explosion in AI that shows no signs of slowing. The rally has lifted co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth to more than $117 billion, making him the 11th wealthiest person in the world, according to Forbes.

Microsoft shares are up about 20% so far this year. The software giant has also been a major beneficiary of the AI boom, after it took a significant stake in OpenAI and integrated the startup’s AI models into its most important products, including Office and Windows. Microsoft is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) for its Azure cloud service. The company just released a new generation of laptops that are designed to run its AI models, called Copilot+.

Nvidia is a newcomer to the title of most valuable U.S. company. For the past few years, Apple and Microsoft have been trading the title.

Nvidia’s ascent has been so rapid that the company has yet to be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a benchmark of 30 stocks that’s historically included the most valuable U.S. companies. Alongside its earnings release last month, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split, which went into effect on Jan. 7.

The split gives Nvidia a better shot at being added to the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, meaning that companies with higher stock prices — rather than market caps — have outsized influence on the benchmark.

"AI Wars: Google stock tumbles -5% premarket as Bard AI gives wrong answer at launch event, Microsoft to incorporate ChatGPT into Bing"," Google’s new AI-powered chatbot Bard has stumbled at the first hurdle after it gave a misleading response during a demonstration at a launch event this week.

The AI search assistant, unveiled on Tuesday, is used by Google to generate text summaries of search results.

Yet in an animated image of Google Bard in action distributed by Google to mark the new feature’s launch, it gives a wrong answer.

The falsehood will raise further questions about the accuracy of search engines and of AI-generated answers to humans’ questions.

The NASA telescope was made operational in December 2021 and has been used by scientists to make several discoveries of new planets outside the Solar System.

Britain blocks Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard,"LONDON — Britain’s top competition regulator on Wednesday moved to block[ Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/)’s acquisition of video game publisher [Activision Blizzard](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ATVI/).

The  measure marks a major blow for the U.S. tech giant, as it seeks to  convince authorities that the deal will benefit competition.

Microsoft said it plans to appeal the decision.

The  U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said that it opposed the deal as  it raises competition concerns in the nascent cloud gaming market.

Microsoft  could make Activision’s games exclusive to its cloud gaming platform,  Xbox Game Pass, cuting off distribution to other key players in the  space, the CMA said.

Cloud gaming is a technology that enables  gamers to access games via companies’ remote servers — effectively  streaming a game like you would a movie on Netflix. The technology is  still in its infancy, but Microsoft is betting big on it becoming a  mainstream way of playing games.

Microsoft announced its intention to acquire Activision Blizzard in January 2022 for $69 billion, in [one of the biggest deals the video game industry has seen](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-buy-activision.html) to date.

Executives  at the Redmond, Washington-based technology giant believe the  acquisition will boost its efforts in gaming by adding lucrative  franchises like Call of Duty and Candy Crush Saga to its content  offerings.

However, some of Microsoft’s competitors contested the  deal, concerned it may give Microsoft a tight grip on the $200 billion  games market. Of particular concern was the prospect that Microsoft [may shut off distribution access to Activision’s popular Call of Duty franchise](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/09/16/microsoft-is-growing-tired-of-sonys-call-of-duty-complaints/?sh=bd568595ebb9) for certain platforms.

[Sony](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/6758.T-JP/), in particular, has voiced concern with Microsoft’s Activision purchase.  The Japanese gaming giant fears that Microsoft could make Call of Duty  exclusive to its Xbox consoles in the long run. 

 Microsoft sought to allay those concerns by offering Sony, [Nintendo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/7974.T-JP/), [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)

and other firms [10-year agreements](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/microsoft-says-it-will-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-for-10-years.html) to continue bringing Call of Duty to their respective gaming platforms.

Microsoft  argues it wouldn’t be financially beneficial to withhold Call of Duty  from PlayStation, Nintendo and other rivals given the licensing income  it generates from keeping the game available on their platforms.

Microsoft  President Brad Smith told CNBC last month that the company is offering  Sony the same agreement as it did Nintendo — to make Call of Duty  available on PlayStation at the same time as on Xbox, with the same  features. Sony still opposes the deal.

The CMA had raised concerns  with the potential for Microsoft to hinder competition in the nascent  cloud gaming market via its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, which  offers cloud gaming among its perks. Microsoft has committed to bring  new Call of Duty titles to Xbox Game Pass on day one of its release.

Cloud  gaming, or the ability to access games via PC or mobile devices over  the internet, is still in its infancy and requires a strong broadband  connection to work well. According to network intelligence firm  Sandvine, cloud gaming made up less than 1% of global internet traffic  in 2022.

Even with the CMA’s blessing, Microsoft will still need to convince other regulators not to block the deal. The EU [continues to probe the merger](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/microsoft-will-bring-xbox-games-to-nvidias-cloud-gaming-service.html) to assess whether it hurts competition, while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission [sued to block the deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/08/ftc-sues-to-block-microsofts-acquisition-of-game-giant-activision-blizzard.html) on antitrust grounds.

500+ OpenAI employees will quit and join Microsoft unless the board resigns and reinstates Sam and Greg,"To the Board of Directors at OpenAI,

OpenAI is the world’s leading AI company. We, the employees of OpenAI, have developed the best models and pushed the field to new frontiers. Our work on AI safety and governance shapes global norms. The products we built are used by millions of people around the world. Until now, the company we work for and cherish has never been in a stronger position.

The process through which you terminated Sam Altman and removed Greg Brockman from the board has jeopardized all of this work and undermined our mission and company. Your conduct has made it clear you did not have the competence to oversee OpenAI.

When we all unexpectedly learned of your decision, the leadership team of OpenAI acted swiftly to stabilize the company. They carefully listened to your concerns and tried to cooperate with you on all grounds. Despite many requests for specific facts for your allegations, you have never provided any written evidence. They also increasingly realized you were not capable of carrying out your duties, and were negotiating in bad faith.

The leadership team suggested that the most stabilizing path forward - the one that would best serve our mission, company, stakeholders, employees and the public - would be for you to resign and put in place a qualified board that could lead the company forward in stability.

Leadership worked with you around the clock to find a mutually agreeable outcome. Yet within two days of your initial decision, you again replaced interim CEO Mira Murati against the best interests of the company. You also informed the leadership team that allowing the company to be destroyed “would be consistent with the mission.”

Your actions have made it obvious that you are incapable of overseeing OpenAI. We are unable to work for or with people that lack competence, judgement and care for our mission and employees. We, the undersigned, may choose to resign from OpenAI and join the newly announced Microsoft subsidiary run by Sam Altman and Greg Brockman. Microsoft has assured us that there are positions for all OpenAI employees at this new subsidiary should we choose to join. We will take this step imminently, unless all current board members resign, and the board appoints two new lead independent directors, such as Bret Taylor and Will Hurd, and reinstates Sam Altman and Greg Brockman.

"Microsoft wins U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets, worth up to $21.9 billion over 10 years","The U.S. Army said Wednesday that Microsoft has won a contract to build more than custom HoloLens augmented reality headsets. The contract for over 120,000 headsets could be worth up to $21.88 billion over 10 years, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC.

The deal shows Microsoft can generate meaningful revenue from a futuristic product resulting from years of research, beyond core areas such as operating systems and productivity software.

It follows a $480 million contract Microsoft received to give the Army prototypes of the Integrated Visual Augmented System, or IVAS, in 2018. The new deal will involve providing production versions.

The standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact using hand and voice gestures. An IVAS prototype that a CNBC reporter tried out in 2019 displayed a map and a compass and had thermal imaging to reveal people in the dark. The system could also show the aim for a weapon.

""The IVAS headset, based on HoloLens and augmented by Microsoft Azure cloud services, delivers a platform that will keep soldiers safer and make them more effective,"" Alex Kipman, a technical fellow at Microsoft and the person who introduced the HoloLens in 2015, wrote in a blog post. ""The program delivers enhanced situational awareness, enabling information sharing and decision-making in a variety of scenarios.""

The headset enables soldiers to fight, rehearse and train in one system, the Army said in a statement. The contract, which was awarded on Friday, has a five-year base period, with a five-year option after that, an Army spokesperson told CNBC an email. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The deal makes Microsoft a more prominent technology supplier to the U.S. military. In 2019, Microsoft secured a contract to provide cloud services to the Defense Department, beating out Amazon, the leader of the public-cloud market. Amazon has been challenging the contract, which could be worth up to $10 billion, in federal court.

Microsoft reportedly plans to invest $10 billion in creator of buzzy A.I. tool ChatGPT,"https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/01/10/microsoft-to-invest-10-billion-in-chatgpt-creator-openai-report-says.html

Microsoft plans to invest $10 billion in OpenAI, the startup behind popular artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT, according to a report from Semafor.

The deal is part of a funding round with other investors involved that would value OpenAI at a whopping $29 billion, Semafor reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

It isn't clear whether the deal has been finalized but term sheets sent to prospective investors indicated the plan was to close the deal by the end of 2022, Semafor reported.

Microsoft will reportedly get a 75% share of OpenAI's profits until it makes back the money on its investment, after which the company would assume a 49% stake in OpenAI.

Microsoft and OpenAI were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.

For several weeks, the tech world has been abuzz with chatter about ChatGPT. The tool is a natural language processing model, meaning it is designed to generate text that appears as though a human wrote it.

The AI model, itself a variant of the GPT-3 family of large language models, has been used for everything from developing code to writing college essays.

A bet on ChatGPT could help Microsoft boost its efforts in web search, a market dominated by Google. The company's Bing browser has only a small share of the global search engine market, however it is hoped the deal could help the firm chip away at Google's dominance by offering more advanced search capabilities.

In December, Morgan Stanley published a report examining whether ChatGPT is a threat to Google. Brian Nowak, the bank's lead analyst on Alphabet, wrote that language models could take market share ""and disrupt Google's position as the entry point for people on the Internet.""

OpenAI, which was founded by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Sam Altman in 2015, launched its ChatGPT to the public in late November. Despite optimism over its potential, the project is burning through cash due to the overwhelming level of pressure on its servers arising from its virality.

"EU approves Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, clearing major hurdle","https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/15/microsoft-activision-deal-eu-approves-takeover-of-call-of-duty-maker.html

European Union regulators on Monday approved Microsoft’s proposed $69 billion acquisition of gaming firm Activision Blizzard, subject to remedies offered by the U.S. tech giant. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said that Microsoft offered remedies in the nascent area of cloud gaming that have staved off antitrust concerns. These remedies centered on allowing users to stream Activision games they purchase on any cloud streaming platform. Europe’s green light is a huge win for Microsoft, after the U.K.’s top competition authority last month blocked the deal. Regulators globally have been probing whether Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision could distort competition in the console and cloud gaming market. One area regulators questioned is whether Microsoft might take Activision games and keep them exclusively on the U.S. giant’s own platforms. Activision is behind some of the biggest console and PC games in the world, including the Call of Duty franchise and World of Warcraft.

The EU decision comes after the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority last month blocked the deal over concerns that it would reduce competition in the nascent cloud gaming market. The CMA said that Microsoft would find it commercially beneficial to make Activision’s key games, such as Call of Duty, exclusive to its own cloud gaming platforms. The CMA nevertheless said the acquisition would not reduce competition in the console market.

Microsoft has faced opposition to the deal from regulators and some of its rivals, including PlayStation games console maker Sony. Microsoft sought to allay the Commission’s concerns over making Activision games exclusive ahead of the EU decision. Microsoft President Brad Smith met with EU officials in February, after which the tech giant said it would bring Xbox PC games to Nvidia’s cloud gaming service. The chipmaker had reportedly expressed opposition to the acquisition takeover. Microsoft also signed a 10-year deal with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to the Japanese gaming giant’s platforms, if the Activison deal closes.",stocks,Microsoft,"EU approves Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, clearing major hurdle European Union regulators on Monday approved Microsoft’s proposed $69 billion acquisition of gaming firm Activision Blizzard, subject to remedies offered by the U.S. tech giant.

Microsoft limits Bing A.I. chats after the chatbot had some unsettling conversations,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/17/microsoft-limits-bing-ai-chats-after-the-chatbot-had-some-unsettling-conversations.html

Microsoft’s Bing AI chatbot will be capped at 50 questions per day and five question-and-answers per individual session, the company said on Friday. The move will limit some scenarios where long chat sessions can “confuse” the chat model, the company said in a blog post. The change comes after early beta testers of the chatbot, which is designed to enhance the Bing search engine, found that it could go off the rails and discuss violence, declare love, and insist that it was right when it was wrong. In a blog post earlier this week, Microsoft blamed long chat sessions of over 15 or more questions for some of the more unsettling exchanges where the bot repeated itself or gave creepy answers.

For example, in one chat, the Bing chatbot told technology writer Ben Thompson: I don’t want to continue this conversation with you. I don’t think you are a nice and respectful user. I don’t think you are a good person. I don’t think you are worth my time and energy. Now, the company will cut off long chat exchanges with the bot. Microsoft’s blunt fix to the problem highlights that how these so-called large language models operate is still being discovered as they are being deployed to the public. Microsoft said it would consider expanding the cap in the future and solicited ideas from its testers. It has said the only way to improve AI products is to put them out in the world and learn from user interactions.

Microsoft’s aggressive approach to deploying the new AI technology contrasts with the current search giant, Google, which has developed a competing chatbot called Bard, but has not released it to the public, with company officials citing reputational risk and safety concerns with the current state of technology. Google is enlisting its employees to check Bard AI’s answers and even make corrections, CNBC previously reported.",stocks,Microsoft,"Microsoft limits Bing A.I. chats after the chatbot had some unsettling conversations Microsoft’s Bing AI chatbot will be capped at 50 questions per day and five question-and-answers per individual session, the company said on Friday.

Microsoft shares drop as cloud miss overshadows better-than-expected revenue,"Microsoft shares fell 7% in extended trading on Tuesday after the software company reported disappointing cloud revenue, overshadowing stronger earnings and revenue than analysts had predicted.

Here’s how the company did, compared with the LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected

Revenue: $64.73 billion vs. $64.39 billion expected

Microsoft’s revenue increased 15% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on June 30, according to a statement. Net income, at $22.04 billion, was up from $20.08 billion, or $2.69 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 29% during the quarter. Analysts polled by CNBC and StreetAccount had expected 31% growth. Microsoft doesn’t disclose revenue from the category in dollars. Last week Google parent Alphabet said revenue from its cloud business, encompassing Workspace productivity software and Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, went up by about 29%. 

During the fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft started selling Surface PCs with AI features that can run certain models locally without the need for an internet connection. Dell, HP and other device makers also touted their own so-called Copilot+ PCs. CEO Satya Nadella said at a press briefing in May that “we’re bringing real joy and a sense of wonder back to creation on the PC.”

Microsoft to appeal IRS request for nearly $29 billion in back taxes,"Microsoft plans to contest a US Internal Revenue Service request for an additional $28.9 billion in back taxes for the years 2004 to 2013, the company said in a securities filing Wednesday.

The demand is the result of a yearslong audit by the IRS into Microsoft’s past accounting practices. In particular, the agency took issue with how the company “allocated profits … among countries and jurisdictions,” Microsoft said in the filing.

“The IRS says Microsoft owes an additional $28.9 billion in tax for 2004 to 2013, plus penalties and interest,” the company said. It noted that the IRS’s determination is not final and does not include up to $10 billion in taxes Microsoft paid under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that could reduce its final bill.

The company said it plans to appeal the IRS request, a process that will likely take several years.

Prediction: Apple is grossly priced compared to Microsoft,"Congrats to those that followed my last Costco post. I don’t believe anyone can really predict the ups and downs of the market, and with the current market climbing past ATH’s, the safest bets are going to be balanced long-short positions in specific equities or spread bets. 

**Apple**

* Market cap: 3.6T
* Current P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 28.6
* Historical revenue growth: Flat to single digits
* Earnings growth: Low double digits
* Net Margin: 25%

 **Microsoft**

* Market cap: 3.2T
* Microsoft P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 32.8
* Historical revenue growth: 15%
* Earnings growth: 15-20%
* Net margin: 35%

Last week, Apple had a higher P/E than MSFT, before this narrowed in the last few days Relative to Microsoft. Apple is still at historically high valuations relative to MSFT, despite Microsoft having better margins and growth. And the reasons are silly. Apple is getting a massive boost due to a ""potential supercycle"" with no proof that it’s actually happening (even the most optimistic projections are just slightly better than last year) and mediocre software releases, while Microsoft took a large hit last quarter because it forecasted larger capex and delays in direct GenAI revenue realization.

In my view, the market is pricing in a divergent and fundamental misunderstanding of GenAI and how it makes money. The Apple bull case hypothesis is correct, it’s just applied to the wrong company. The Microsoft supercycle isn’t going to be from direct GenAI subscriptions like Co-pilot, it’s going to be share shift towards Azure and increased utilization.

To me it is hopium to believe that retail consumers will be rushing aggressively to switch or upgrade their phones over a nascent GenAI capability that is inferior to its peers (other than privacy) and unlocks nominal value, while mid-large corporates won’t be doing the exact same for Microsoft for what is widely considered a top-notch set of capabilities and proven effectiveness in several emerging use cases.

Here’s my prediction – regardless of where the market goes, I believe there is going to be a strong and continued divergence between Microsoft & Apple performance in the next few months, with at least another 5% gap between the winner and loser, with Microsoft’s P/E once against comfortably retaking the lead from Apple. Good luck and we'll see!

Microsoft earnings are out – here are the numbers,"Microsoft reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings: $2.48 vs $2.31 per share, adjusted, as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue: $51.73 billion vs $50.88 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

After two consecutive quarters of revenue growth of over 20%, analysts expect a slowdown to 18% in the fiscal second quarter. That would bring the company back in line with its performance over the prior two and a half years.

Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment, which contains the Azure public cloud, GitHub and server products such as Windows Server, generated $18.33 billion in revenue. That works out to 25.5% growth, and it’s a bit more than the $18.30 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.

Revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 46%. The expectation was 46%, according to a CNBC survey of 15 analysts, while analysts polled by StreetAccount had been looking for 45.3% Azure growth.

Amy Hood, Microsoft’s finance chief, eased investor concerns on the earnings call, indicating that demand remains strong across much of the business.

Hood said the company expects revenue of $48.5 billion to 49.3 billion in the fiscal third quarter, topping the $48.23 billion Refinitiv consensus. Hood said the company now expects full-year operating margins to widen slightly.

"Microsoft Is Looking To Acquire Nintendo “At Some Point”, Mario Maker’s Future “Exists Off Of Its Hardware”","https://twistedvoxel.com/microsoft-looking-to-acquire-nintendo-future-exists-off-of-its-hw/

Microsoft is looking to acquire Nintendo “at some point”, and it believes that the Mario maker’s future “exists off of its own hardware”. Through a flurry of leaked documents involved in the court case between the FTC and Microsoft, it has been revealed that the software giant has been looking to acquire Nintendo since the year 2020. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer believes that the acquisition of Nintendo by Microsoft would be a “career moment” for him, and he believes it would be a good move for both companies.

In his email to Microsoft’s Executive Vice President and Commercial Chief Marketing Officer, Takeshi Numoto, and Chief Marketing Officer, Chris Capossela, Spencer stated that it’s just taking a long time for Nintendo to see that its future “exists off of their own hardware”, but he is firm in his belief that the acquisition will happen “at some point”, and that Nintendo will eventually see things the way Microsoft does. Nintendo has yet to comment on the leaked statement from Phil Spencer.

Addressing Numoto, Spencer stated that he totally agreed that Nintendo is the prime asset for Microsoft in the Gaming business, and that, today, Gaming is the company’s most likely path to consumer relevance. He mentioned that he has had numerous conversations with the LT of Nintendo about tighter collaboration and felt that if any US company would have a chance with Nintendo, Microsoft would probably be in the best position. According to him, the unfortunate (or fortunate for Nintendo) situation is that the Mario maker is “sitting on a big pile of cash”. He said that Nintendo has a Board of Directors (BoD) that, until recently, have not pushed for further increases in market growth or stock appreciation. He clarified that he said “until recently”, as Microsoft’s former BoD member, ValueAct, has been heavily acquiring shares of Nintendo.",stocks,Microsoft,"Microsoft Is Looking To Acquire Nintendo “At Some Point”, Mario Maker’s Future “Exists Off Of Its Hardware” Microsoft is looking to acquire Nintendo “at some point”, and it believes that the Mario maker’s future “exists off of its own hardware”.

A leaked document from Google shows they believe Wall Street is too bullish on Microsoft’s Azure business,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/21/google-leaked-doc-microsoft-azure-losing-money-on-29-bln-in-revenue.html

Google has for years been playing catch-up in the cloud infrastructure market, where it’s seen in the industry as a distant third in the U.S., behind Amazon and Microsoft. The challenge for investors is that the three companies don’t report cloud infrastructure metrics in a way that makes them easily comparable. However, an internal estimate assembled by Google employees, based on a leaked Microsoft document and some extrapolation of other market statistics, suggests Google believes it’s closer to second place than analysts think.

Google’s document estimates that Microsoft generated under $29 billion in Azure consumption revenue in the latest fiscal year, which ended June 30, reflecting the value of cloud infrastructure services used by clients. That’s several billion dollars less than what Wall Street analysts had forecast. Bank of America was the most bullish, predicting Azure would pull in $37.5 billion in fiscal 2022. Cowen predicted revenue of $33.9 billion and UBS said $32.3 billion. The document from Google has Azure ending the 2022 fiscal year with an operating loss of almost $3 billion, down from a loss of more than $5 billion the prior year. It claims that Azure’s sales and marketing costs approached $10 billion, accounting for 34% of consumption revenue. Microsoft said sales and marketing costs for the whole company equaled 11% of revenue over the same period.

One analyst dismissed Google’s bottom-line tally. “There’s no way it’s that big of a loss,” said Derrick Wood, an analyst at Cowen who has the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft stock. His research shows Azure boasting an operating margin above 30%, compared with Google’s estimate of a -10% margin. According to data from Gartner, AWS controlled 39% of the global cloud infrastructure market in 2021, followed by Microsoft at 21%, China’s Alibaba at 9.5% and Google at 7.1%.",stocks,Microsoft,"A leaked document from Google shows they believe Wall Street is too bullish on Microsoft’s Azure business Google has for years been playing catch-up in the cloud infrastructure market, where it’s seen in the industry as a distant third in the U.S., behind Amazon and Microsoft.

It’s ‘really the Google web’: Microsoft CEO testifies about how hard it is to break into search during antitrust trial,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/02/microsoft-ceo-testifies-about-competing-with-google-in-antitrust-trial.html

When it comes to online search, it’s Google’s web and everyone else is playing in it, according to rival Microsoft. That was the essence of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s testimony in federal court on Monday as part of the government’s antitrust trial against Google. Nadella told the court that Google’s dominant market share in online search means that publishers and advertisers shape their content to Google’s requirements, making it harder for competitors like Microsoft’s Bing to gain a foothold.

“Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web,” Nadella said from the stand in Washington, D.C., District Court. Nadella was referring to the way publishers often cater their content and advertising to Google’s products, like by optimizing their pages for how Google ranks search results. Nadella was questioned by lawyers for the Department of Justice and a coalition of state attorneys general who are suing Google for allegedly violating antitrust laws by illegally maintaining a monopoly in the general search market. The government argues that Google locked up distribution channels for general search engines through exclusive deals with browser and phone makers to be the default choice on various devices. Perhaps the most famous of those deals is the multibillion-dollar agreement between Google and Apple to make Google search the default on Apple products like the iPhone.

The government has tried to make the case that Google’s dominance, aided by these exclusive deals, creates a flywheel effect, where greater exposure to users leads to more data to make Google’s search results better and attracts more advertisers to the product. That, in turn, generates more revenue that can be used to fund these massive distribution deals. Meanwhile, the government argues, it becomes even harder for rivals to breakthrough to consumers, and as a result, they miss out on the opportunity for greater benefits or innovations in search. Nadella affirmed that argument in his testimony Monday, describing the obstacles a general search competitor like Bing faces to gain more market share from Google.",stocks,Microsoft,"It’s ‘really the Google web’: Microsoft CEO testifies about how hard it is to break into search during antitrust trial When it comes to online search, it’s Google’s web and everyone else is playing in it, according to rival Microsoft.

Nadella was questioned by lawyers for the Department of Justice and a coalition of state attorneys general who are suing Google for allegedly violating antitrust laws by illegally maintaining a monopoly in the general search market. The government argues that Google locked up distribution channels for general search engines through exclusive deals with browser and phone makers to be the default choice on various devices. Perhaps the most famous of those deals is the multibillion-dollar agreement between Google and Apple to make Google search the default on Apple products like the iPhone. The government has tried to make the case that Google’s dominance, aided by these exclusive deals, creates a flywheel effect, where greater exposure to users leads to more data to make Google’s search results better and attracts more advertisers to the product. That, in turn, generates more revenue that can be used to fund these massive distribution deals. Meanwhile, the government argues, it becomes even harder for rivals to breakthrough to consumers, and as a result, they miss out on the opportunity for greater benefits or innovations in search. Nadella affirmed that argument in his testimony Monday, describing the obstacles a general search competitor like Bing faces to gain more market share from Google.",0.16493055555555555,1

"Meta, Microsoft and Amazon team up on maps project to crack Apple-Google duopoly","https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/meta-microsoft-amazon-join-overture-maps-to-vie-with-apple-google.html

Google and Apple dominate the market for online maps, charging mobile app developers for access to their mapping services. The other mega-cap tech companies are joining together to help create another option. A group formed by Meta, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, along with TomTom, is releasing data that could enable companies to build their own maps, without having to rely on Google or Apple. The Overture Maps Foundation, which was established late last year, captured 59 million “points of interest,” such as restaurants, landmarks, streets and regional borders. The data has been cleaned and formatted so it can be used for free as the base layer for a new map application.

Meta and Microsoft collected and donated the data to Overture, according to Marc Prioleau, executive director of the OMF. Data on places is often difficult to collect and license, and building map data requires lots of time and staff to gather and clean it, he told CNBC in an interview. “We have some companies that, if they wanted to invest to build the map data, they could,” Prioleau said. Rather than spending that kind of money, he said, companies were asking, “Can we just get collaboration around the open base map?” Overture is aiming to establish a baseline for maps data so that companies can use it to build and operate their own maps.

For many companies, Google’s and Apple’s maps aren’t ideal, because they don’t provide access to the underlying data. Instead, those companies allow app makers to use their maps as a service and, in many cases, charge each time the underlying map is accessed. For example, app makers pay per thousand Google Maps lookups through an application programming interface (API). Apple allows access to Apple Maps for free for native app developers, but web app developers need to pay. “That works for a lot of people, but not for others,” Prioleau said.

BlackRock and Microsoft plan $30bn fund to invest in AI infrastructure,"  
[https://www.ft.com/content/4441114b-a105-439c-949b-1e7f81517deb](https://www.ft.com/content/4441114b-a105-439c-949b-1e7f81517deb)

BlackRock is preparing to launch a more than $30bn artificial intelligence investment fund with technology giant Microsoft to build data centres and energy projects to meet growing demands stemming from AI.  

The financial partnership, which BlackRock is launching with its new infrastructure investment unit, Global Infrastructure Partners, would be one of the biggest investment vehicles ever raised on Wall Street. Microsoft and MGX, the Abu Dhabi-backed investment company, are general partners in the fund. Nvidia, the fast-growing chipmaker, will advise on factory design and integration. 

The investment vehicle is aimed at addressing the staggering power and digital infrastructure demands of building AI products that are expected to face severe capacity bottlenecks in coming years. The computing power of AI requires far more energy than previous technological innovations and has strained existing energy infrastructure. 

Dubbed the Global AI Investment Partnership, the effort seeks to raise up to $30bn in equity investments and leverage that to support up to an additional $70bn in debt financing. 

The fund would mark GIP’s first big fund since the private infrastructure investment group agreed to be acquired by BlackRock for $12.5bn earlier this year. That deal is due to close in October.

BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, has highlighted the energy sector as one of its top opportunities for growth. “Mobilising private capital to build AI infrastructure like data centres and power will unlock a multitrillion-dollar long-term investment opportunity,” Larry Fink, BlackRock chief executive, said in a statement.

The soon-to-be launched fund is the latest vehicle created by a large asset manager to meet the ever-growing demand for energy to power generative AI and cloud computing. Earlier this year Microsoft agreed to back $10bn in renewable electricity projects built by Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management. Microsoft has made a commitment to ensure 100 per cent of its energy consumption is matched by zero carbon energy purchases by 2030.  

“The country and the world are going to need more capital investment to accelerate the development of the AI infrastructure needed. This kind of effort is an important step,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president. 

MGX was created earlier this year with the backing of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala to advance the country’s progress in AI. It has been in talks to invest in Open AI’s next funding round. 

In 2017, Blackstone announced plans for a $40bn infrastructure vehicle with backing from Saudi Arabia, and Brookfield last year raised $28bn for what was described as the largest ever infrastructure fund. 

The International Energy Agency estimates that global electricity consumption by data centres could surpass 1,000 terawatt-hours by 2026, more than twice the amount used in 2022.  Recommended LexBig Tech Data centres have turned Big Tech into big spenders Premium content 

“Accelerated computing and generative AI are driving a growing need for AI infrastructure for the next industrial revolution,” Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s founder, said in a statement. 

In the US, which hosts one-third of the world’s data centres, electricity demand is rising rapidly for the first time in two decades, driven partly by these energy-intensive facilities. A report from Grid Strategies indicates that five-year projections for electricity demand growth in the US have nearly doubled over the past year, increasing from 2.6 per cent to 4.7 per cent.

Q2 Earnings - Microsoft beats estimates as Azure grows faster than expected,"Here’s how the company performed, compared with consensus among analysts polled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings: $2.93 per share, vs. $2.78 per share expected

Revenue: $62.02 billion, vs. $61.12 billion expected

Microsoft’s revenue increased 17.6% year over year in the year, which ended on Dec. 31, according to a statement. Net income, at $21.87 billion, or $2.93 per share, increased from $16.43 billion, or $2.20 per share.

The company’s Intelligent Cloud segment produced $25.88 billion in revenue, up 20% and above the $25.29 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. The grouping contains Azure cloud infrastructure, SQL Server, Windows Server, Nuance, GitHub and enterprise services.

Within that segment, revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 30%. Analysts polled by CNBC had expected 27.7% growth, and the StreetAccount consensus was 27.5%. The metric for the previous quarter was 29%.

Revenue from the Productivity and Business Processes unit including Office productivity software, LinkedIn and Dynamics totaled $19.25 billion. That was up 13% and higher than the $18.99 billion StreetAccount consensus.

The More Personal Computing segment contributed $16.89 billion in revenue, up about 19% and more than the StreetAccount consensus of $16.79 billion. The segment comprises Windows, Surface, Bing and Xbox.

During the fiscal second quarter, Microsoft closed its acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard, its largest deal ever. The company also announced custom cloud chips and started selling a $30 monthly Copilot artificial intelligence add-on to Microsoft 365 productivity software bundles.

But layoffs continued. Microsoft’s LinkedIn subsidiary cut around 700 jobs in October on top of the 10,000 announced earlier in the year. Last week, Microsoft said it’s eliminating around 1,900 employees in its gaming unit, or about 9% of headcount, following the Activision deal.

A Three Mile Island nuclear reactor could restart under a new deal with Microsoft,"https://www.inquirer.com/business/energy/three-mile-island-microsoft-constellation-proposal-20240920.html

Five years after a nuclear reactor at the Three Mile Island plant in central Pennsylvania closed amid financial troubles, its owner wants to bring it back online.

Baltimore-based Constellation Energy Corp. said Friday that it has signed a 20-year agreement with Microsoft under which the technology company will purchase power from Three Mile Island Unit 1. That reactor is located at an independent facility from Unit 2, which closed in 1979 after experiencing a partial meltdown

Constellation said it would spend $1.6 billion to restart Unit 1 — and won’t seek any public subsidies — which the company said “operated at industry-leading levels of safety and reliability for decades.” Federal regulators would need to approve a restart, though it already has support from Gov. Josh Shapiro. The company said it expects the reactor to come online by 2028.

“I think policymakers have recognized that a strategy that is dependent just on wind, solar, batteries isn’t going to fully get us there and meet the needs of the system from a reliability standpoint,” Joe Dominguez, Constellation’s president and CEO, said in an interview.

For Microsoft, buying energy from the renewed plant, dubbed the Crane Clean Energy Center, will “help match the power its data centers in PJM use with carbon-free energy,” according to a news release. Valley Forge-based PJM Interconnection, a regional transmission organization, operates the electric grid in 13 states, including Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

Exelon Generation pulled the plug on 837-megawatt Unit 1 in 2019 after state lawmakers declined to support legislation that would have directed hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies from Pennsylvania electric customers to the state’s nuclear industry.

Baltimore-based Constellation Energy Corp. said Friday that it has signed a 20-year agreement with Microsoft under which the technology company will purchase power from Three Mile Island Unit 1. That reactor is located at an independent facility from Unit 2, which closed in 1979 after experiencing a partial meltdown Constellation said it would spend $1.6 billion to restart Unit 1 — and won’t seek any public subsidies — which the company said “operated at industry-leading levels of safety and reliability for decades.” Federal regulators would need to approve a restart, though it already has support from Gov. Josh Shapiro. The company said it expects the reactor to come online by 2028. “I think policymakers have recognized that a strategy that is dependent just on wind, solar, batteries isn’t going to fully get us there and meet the needs of the system from a reliability standpoint,” Joe Dominguez, Constellation’s president and CEO, said in an interview. For Microsoft, buying energy from the renewed plant, dubbed the Crane Clean Energy Center, will “help match the power its data centers in PJM use with carbon-free energy,” according to a news release. Valley Forge-based PJM Interconnection, a regional transmission organization, operates the electric grid in 13 states, including Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Exelon Generation pulled the plug on 837-megawatt Unit 1 in 2019 after state lawmakers declined to support legislation that would have directed hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies from Pennsylvania electric customers to the state’s nuclear industry.

Microsoft Reportedly Tried to Sell Bing to Apple in 2020,"Microsoft executives tried to sell the company’s Bing search engine to Apple around 2020, pitching the deal as a way for the iPhone maker to replace Google as the default search engine in Apple’s Safari browser, Bloomberg reported. The talks never reached an advanced stage, according to the report.

The revelation comes as the U.S. Department of Justice seeks to prove to a federal judge that Google violated antitrust laws by abusing its dominance over the search market. Google’s deal with Apple to share ad revenue in exchange for default status in Safari, and whether that agreement made it impossible for challengers like Bing to compete, have been a key part of the ongoing antitrust trial in Washington. Microsoft’s alleged sale effort appears to bolster the government’s contention that Google locked up the market to the point where its top competitor was willing to throw in the towel. It also shows that Apple, the world’s most valuable company, preferred to stick with the Google deal than pick a costly battle in search.

Microsoft shares rise on better-than-expected earnings and revenue,"Microsoft shares rose in extended trading on Tuesday after the company reported fiscal second quarter financials that topped analysts’ estimates.

Here’s how the company did:

Earnings: $2.32 per share, adjusted, vs. $2.29 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue: $52.75 billion, vs. $52.94 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Microsoft’s total revenue increased by 2% year over year in that quarter ending Dec. 31, the slowest rate since 2016, according to a statement. Net income fell to $16.43 billion from $18.77 billion in the year-ago quarter. The company took a $1.2 billion charge in the quarter in connection with its decision to cut 10,000 employees, revise its hardware lineup and consolidate leases.

The decision to reduce head count “shows a commitment to margin defense despite top-line shakiness,” analysts at Raymond James wrote in a note to clients Monday. They recommend buying Microsoft shares.

In the quarter the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued Microsoft to block its pending $69 billion acquisition of game publisher Activision Blizzard, while the U.S. Defense Department awarded Microsoft and three other companies a cloud contract worth up to $9 billion combined. Also, Microsoft introduced Designer, an application in which people can craft documents such as social media posts and event invitations.

Microsoft faces wide-ranging U.S. antitrust probe,"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened a broad antitrust investigation into Microsoft, including of its software licensing and cloud computing businesses, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

The probe was approved by FTC Chair Lina Khan ahead of her likely departure in January. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, and the expectation he will appoint a fellow Republican with a softer approach toward business, leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air.  
  
The FTC is examining allegations the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to other competitive platforms, sources confirmed earlier this month.  
  
The FTC is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products, the source said on Wednesday.

Microsoft declined to comment on Wednesday.  
  
The FTC fielded complaints about Microsoft last year as it examined the cloud computing market.

NetChoice, a lobbying group that represents online companies including Amazon and Google, which compete with Microsoft in cloud computing, criticized Microsoft’s licensing policies, and its integration of AI tools into its Office and Outlook.

“Given that Microsoft is the world’s largest software company, dominating in productivity and operating systems software, the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary,” the group said.  
The FTC has demanded a broad range of detailed information from Microsoft, Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday.  
  
Until now, Microsoft has been somewhat of an exception to U.S. antitrust regulators’ recent campaign against allegedly anticompetitive practices at Big Tech companies.  
  
Facebook owner Meta Platforms, Apple, and Amazon.com Inc. have all been accused by the U.S. of unlawfully maintaining monopolies.  
  
Alphabet’s Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.  
  
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified at Google’s trial, saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence.  
  
It is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech, whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes. JD Vance, the incoming vice president, has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse.  
  
Still, Microsoft has benefited from Trump policies in the past.  
  
In 2019, the Pentagon awarded it a $10 billion cloud computing contract that Amazon had widely been expected to win. Amazon later alleged that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from its Amazon Web Services unit.

Microsoft earnings are out – here are the numbers,"Microsoft shares rose 5% in extended trading on Thursday after the software maker issued fiscal third-quarter results that outdid Wall Street’s expectations. 

Here’s how the company did in comparison with the consensus from LSEG: 

Earnings per share: $2.94 vs. $2.82 expected

Revenue: $61.86 vs. $60.80 billion expected

Microsoft’s total revenue grew 17% year over year in the quarter, which ended on March 31, according to a statement.

During the quarter, Microsoft introduced Surface PCs with a key for quickly accessing the Copilot chatbot. The company started selling access to the Copilot for small businesses with Microsoft 365 productivity software subscriptions and hired Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of artificial intelligence lab DeepMind, to run a new Microsoft AI group. Suleyman had been co-founder and CEO of startup Inflection, and many of its employees also joined Microsoft.

“We have been operating with speed and intensity and this infusion of new talent will enable us to accelerate our pace yet again,” CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a memo about the Inflection deal, which was reportedly worth $650 million.

This marks the first full quarter for sales of the Copilot add-on for commercial Microsoft 365 customers. In a note on Sunday, analysts at Piper Sandler warned clients not to expect many financial details from Microsoft.

So far this year, Microsoft stock is up 4%, while the S&P 500 index has gained about 5%.

"Meta and Alphabet lose dominance over US digital ads market as TikTok, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple take market share.","https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/12/meta-and-alphabet-lose-dominance-over-us-digital-ads-market/

Meta and Alphabet have lost their dominance over the digital advertising market they have ruled for years, as the duopoly is hit by fast-growing competition from rivals Amazon, TikTok, Microsoft and Apple. The share of US ad revenues held by Facebook’s parent Meta and Google owner Alphabet is projected to fall by 2.5 percentage points to 48.4 percent this year, the first time the two groups will not hold a majority share of the market since 2014, according to research group Insider Intelligence. This will mark the fifth consecutive annual decline for the duopoly, whose share of the market has fallen from a peak of 54.7 percent in 2017 and is forecast to decline to 43.9 percent by 2024. Worldwide, Meta and Alphabet’s share declined 1 percentage point to 49.5 percent this year.

“Four years ago, you wouldn’t be talking about either [TikTok or Amazon] in advertising,” said Dischler. “So it’s really telling that more and more people are acknowledging that advertising is a great and scalable business model.” Amazon’s foray into the digital ads world has played a big part in hitting Meta and Google’s dominance. After years of toying in the market, it ramped efforts up in 2015 and has since seen ad revenues skyrocket from less than $1 billion to an estimated $38 billion this year. “Before I joined, I didn’t even know what Amazon Ads was,” said an Amazon executive who says they now run “a massive team—and I didn’t know this existed before the recruiter called.” Paul Prior, chief operating officer of Undertone, a digital advertising company, said retail giants led by Amazon woke up to the realization that their extensive data on customers could be the basis for a massive advertising business with higher margins than the sale of goods online. But Amazon then went a step further, expanding its on-site ads business beyond its own shopping site. “Across the wider digital universe, they use that data set to empower brands and the advertisers to buy better, to spend more effectively and drive return on ad-spend,” said Prior.

Apple has also emerged as a new threat. Its ad revenues have grown from under $2.2 billion in 2018 to more than $7 billion this year. Although that is just 1.2 percent of the global market, it is already more than Snapchat and Pinterest combined, and some estimates suggest Apple could reach $30 billion of ad revenue by 2026. Zuckerberg has repeatedly hit out at Apple’s “conflict of interest,” criticizing it for charging “monopoly rents” and stifling innovation.

I'm going to do a deep-dive into the fundamentals and catalysts that could make Microsoft a good buy. As always, a TL;DR is at the bottom and if you have any companies you want to see me do a DD on, leave them in the comments.

**Business**

Microsoft is a well-known diversified technology company. Most consumers are familiar with their windows operating system, which has a 75% desktop OS market share as of 2020 ***\[1\]***, their Microsoft Surface Laptop, which they've advertised aggressively, and their Office 365 productivity suite, which is commonly used in schools and businesses alike.

Their operations can be broken up into 3 broad categories: Productivity and Business Processes (32.44% of revenue),  Intelligent Cloud (33.82% of revenue), and Personal Computing (33.74% of revenue). Let's break these segments down!

**Productivity and Business Processes**

This segment includes Microsoft's Office product line, LinkedIn, and Dynamics.

Office saw stellar growth during the pandemic. In Microsoft's 10-K filed in June of 2020, we can see that Office revenue grew by 4.5B or 15%. Office accounts for 64.63% of this segment's revenue. I don't see all that much future growth potential here. Google's productivity suite will cut into margins and makes the moat here very small. While Office Commercial could be alright, Office Consumer will probably get blown out of the water by Google's free product offering.

LinkedIn is another pandemic out-performer. This product grew revenue 1.3B or 20% in 2020 and currently accounts for 14% of this segment's revenue. There's a lot of unrealized potential here and I want to go a little in-depth here because I think this is overlooked by a lot of people.

Think about the amount of data LinkedIn has for a second. You **willingly** enter in: your current place of residence, your age, your current place of work, your past working experience, your prior education, your interests, what skills you have, etc. This is a data *GOLDMINE.* All the information Google spends billions on developing algos to infer about you is offered up to Microsoft by over 740 million members **\[2\]**. If Microsoft identifies this as an opportunity they'd be willing to pursue, it could be huge.

Finally, there's Microsoft Dynamics. I feel so-so about this product. It has fierce competitors who dominate the entire CRM industry (namely Salesforce with 19%+ market share), and I just don't think they have a superior offering here.

**Intelligent Cloud**

This is what many people end up talking about the most when it comes to Microsoft. As someone with a pretty decent amount of cloud knowledge, I can say with confidence it'll be a two-horse game in the future with AWS and Azure dominating. The problem with AWS is actually the fact that they're a subsidiary of Amazon!

If you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts.

**Personal Computing**

This segment includes Windows OS, the Surface Laptop, Xbox, and their Search engines.

I don't expect that much growth here. Windows will continue to grow by 2-4%, their search engine will probably stagnate (I'm kind of shocked people actually use Edge/Bing), Xbox will continue to lose ground to Playstation, and Surface's growth will slow.

**Business TL;DR**

Future growth will be driven by Azure and perhaps LinkedIn.

**Revenues**

Microsoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft.

Switching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent.

**Margins**

Microsoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.

**Assets/Liabilities**

||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B|

Microsoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good.

It's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus.

**Free Cash Flow/Buybacks**

As of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends ***\[3\]*** and has netted shareholders billions.

**Price Ratios/Other**

**PE Ratio**

I said a ""good"" number for the sector was under 30x. I usually look for PEs under 15-20x, but you do have to pay for growth. In this section, nobody was under this threshold. Considering we're in a mature bull-market, I can't say I'm surprised. With that being said, Microsoft narrowly beat out Google to have the second-lowest PE at 34.33x.

**P/B Ratio**

I said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 7x. Very high, I know, but keep in mind these are good values for the *technology* sector. That being said, only Google came in under my good value while the rest weren't even close. Microsoft had the second-lowest P/B at 13.34x. So far, not so good.

**P/S Ratio**

I thought a good P/S ratio here would be under 7x (same as the P/B cutoff). This time, we saw both Google and Amazon qualify with Apple narrowly missing the cutoff. Microsoft ended up having the highest P/S ratio at 11.78x. Overall, P/S ratios were actually decent.

**P/FCF Ratio**

I identified under 30x to be a good multiple for this sector. Sadly, we're right back to where we were before, with only Apple qualifying and the rest being pretty far off. Microsoft had the second-worst P/FCF ratio at 35.79x.

**ROE/Leverage/Revenue Growth**

Microsoft: If you're going to have poor price ratios, the least you can do is be efficient at generating capital. A 42.19% ROE while maintaining reasonable leverage considering their revenue growth rate is impressive. This is one area where Microsoft actually looks pretty attractive.

Apple: Not a big fan of the numbers here. They strike me as over-levered and a future slow-grower.

Google: They have the lowest ROE of the bunch, but they're also the least levered. Considering the amount of growth they've had, the only way I could get behind this little leverage would be if management expected stagnation over the coming years.

Amazon: Amazon is very solid in this area. They have a reasonable amount of leverage considering expected future growth and are pretty efficient at generating capital.

Overall, Microsoft is good at generating capital and is well-levered considering expected and past growth rates.

**Moderate DCF Valuation**

Assuming a 15% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 46% EBITDA Margin, Microsoft has an FV of $212.22 (upside of -10.1%).

**Bull Case**

In my bull case, I'm assuming Microsoft successfully monetizes LinkedIn, and Azure growth is faster than expected. I'm assuming a 17% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 47% EBITDA Margin. Using these parameters, I got an FV of $270.80 (14.8% upside).

I think the FV is probably between the current price and this bull case.

**Bear Case**

Don't worry, this won't be a Cathie Wood bear case!

In this scenario, I'm assuming Azure loses market share, and Office growth stagnates. I think fair parameters in this scenario would be a 7% revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 45% EBITDA Margin. In this scenario, I got an FV of $168.89 (-28.4% upside).

I find this bear case highly unlikely. In my opinion, the idea that Azure growth will slow is misguided.

**Risks**

1. **Office loses market share:** I've been talking about this one throughout the DD because I think it's probably a very likely scenario. The average consumer is going to prefer the Google Productivity Suite over Office because it's free and offers products equivalent in quality. If this were to happen, Office Commercial (Office for businesses and schools) would probably remain relatively intact.
2. **Azure gets trounced**: As I said in the previous section, I find this scenario very unlikely. It would require GCP being worth a dang or everyone snuggling up to Amazon. As I said before, a lot of companies won't go with AWS because it would be supporting a competitor and I don't think the people running GCP will be able to get their ducks in a row.
3. **Rotation into Value:** If bond yields were to continue rising rapidly, a flight to safety could ensue that would cause a selloff in tech stocks such as Microsoft.
4. **Regulation:** While I don't see any regulation risk for Microsoft in particular, if any of the FAANG stocks were to get hit with an anti-trust violation, it would send big-cap tech stocks into a tailspin.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

While Microsoft is a great company with large amounts of growth ahead of it, the current valuation is frothy and there isn't enough of a margin of safety to justify an investment.

Gamepass, their acquisitions of IP, and discord integration will be highly beneficial. I apologize for overlooking that. Secondly, I would like to clarify my statements about Office.

Today I'm going to be covering a massive tech-giant called Microsoft. They have a market cap of 1.74T and are the second-largest company in the US. I'm going to do a deep-dive into the fundamentals and catalysts that could make Microsoft a good buy. As always, a TL;DR is at the bottom and if you have any companies you want to see me do a DD on, leave them in the comments. **Business** Microsoft is a well-known diversified technology company. Most consumers are familiar with their windows operating system, which has a 75% desktop OS market share as of 2020 ***\[1\]***, their Microsoft Surface Laptop, which they've advertised aggressively, and their Office 365 productivity suite, which is commonly used in schools and businesses alike. Their operations can be broken up into 3 broad categories: Productivity and Business Processes (32.44% of revenue), Intelligent Cloud (33.82% of revenue), and Personal Computing (33.74% of revenue).

"Video explaining the huge growth of large cap growth stocks (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, FB, GOOGL)","I've seen this question everywhere on this sub: ""why did apple/tesla/[insert large growth company name here] growth so much so quick! They still haven't made a lot of profit! We are in a bubble!""

Well, it is difficult to explain why to every person individually and this new video from Ben Felix explains the reason why expertly.

https://youtu.be/foqswJT3Spc

The conclusion the video comes to is that you should just stick to low cost index funds (preferably globally diversified) rather than investing into large cap growth or trying to find the next Apple or Amazon.

**EDIT:** The definition of a ""growth"" company (as literally explained in the video) is a company that is ""expensive"" relative to the market. Expensive how? Well, relative to some fundamental ratio like P/B or P/E. Considering all the companies I have listed in my title have relatively high P/E and P/B ratios, you can say they are expensive. This makes them by definition a growth company. This isn't that hard to understand. If I said they are tech companies, no one would argue because they literally are tech companies. Well, just as much as they are tech companies, they are growth companies. They might not all be as expensive as each other, but relative to the market, they are expensive.

"Why is GOOG worth so much less than AAPL, AMZN, MSFT?","At time of writing, GOOG market cap is $1.06T and other tech giants are much higher (AAPL is $2.01T, AMZN is $1.65T, MSFT is $1.61T). That gap feels large to me. Also, FB is valued at $760B with much lower revenue and decelerating growth, so its gap vs GOOG seems small. 

Is GOOG a good buy? Are these other companies just overvalued? Curious what you all think.  
Here's my thinking:

* GOOG has rock-solid fundamentals - excellent gross margins, has maintained \~15%+ YoY revenue growth even at their scale, and search is a steady business with many entrypoints across the Google ecosystem
* GOOG has bets across so many forward-looking industries that I think they will be able to diversify over time and don't have real risk of not continuing to innovate. There's of course the risk of anti-trust and privacy regulations, but that's been true for years now (although things do appear to be ratcheting up).
* It seems their stock hasn't mooned during covid because a meaningful share of search volume (and subsequently search revenue) comes from brick-and-mortar businesses (as opposed to someone like FB, whose ads biz is more of an ecommerce/direct-to-consumer play), which puts a drag on their revenue.

Collaboration Alert: MSFT and OpenAI Launch $100 Billion Supercomputer Venture,"ARTICLE TLDR: Microsoft and OpenAI are reportedly collaborating on a massive data-center project estimated to cost up to $100 billion. The initiative includes the development of an artificial intelligence supercomputer named ""Stargate."" While the companies have not officially commented on the project, sources suggest that Microsoft will likely finance it. Stargate is anticipated to be operational by 2028, marking the final phase of OpenAI's AI upgrade. This U.S.-based supercomputer is part of a series of installations planned over the next six years. The projected cost of $100 billion has been attributed to conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft's initial cost estimates. The project is progressing through five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase, while Microsoft is concurrently working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI. The focus of the current phase is on procuring AI chips necessary for the subsequent phases.

10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:

1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.
2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.  The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB.   SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF.  Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive.  Index methodology here: [https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf](https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf)
3. DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl) .  Its methodology is in the prospectus, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus) .  Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to [etfrc.com](https://etfrc.com). So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way.  Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ.  Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF!
4. SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund) . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change.""  ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s) ).  Methodology here: [https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index](https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index) .  It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in.  It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year!
5. FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, [https://freedometfs.com/frdm/](https://freedometfs.com/frdm/) . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores.  Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red.  If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like.  Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF.  Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox!
6. EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund) . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index.  Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil.  It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all).  Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung.
7. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf) .  One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets.  Really heavy on tech and luxury.  If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like.  High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH.
8. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html) .  Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options.  Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times.  Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF.  Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement.  Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X.
9. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx) .  Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries.  But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure.  Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund.  There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design.
10. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf) .  This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF.  You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise.  But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values.  Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk.  A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields.

ok, here's a bonus #11:

11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA) .  This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.  But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted.  US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along.  Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future.

What do you guys think?  Any of those look like something you might invest in?  Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?

Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade. 2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [ . This ETF is... highly intriguing. It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%). They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM. Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily). What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology. Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit. The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO. The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB. SQ comes in at , which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF. Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive. Index methodology here: [ 3. DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, [ . Its methodology is in the prospectus, [ . Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to [etfrc.com]( So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way. Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ. Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF! 4. SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, [ . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change."" ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: [ ). Methodology here: [ . It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in. It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year! 5. FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, [ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores. Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red. If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like. Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF. Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox! 6. EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, [ . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index. Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil. It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all). Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung. 7. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, [ . One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets. Really heavy on tech and luxury. If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like. High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH. 8. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, [ . Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options. Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times. Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF. Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement. Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X. 9. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, [ . Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries. But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure. Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund. There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design. 10. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, [ . This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF. You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise. But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values. Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk. A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields. ok, here's a bonus : 11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, [ . This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year. But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted. US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along. Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future. What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund? &; edit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up! I'm so happy many people are finding this discussion informative. Thanks for the awards and comments.",0.13039913954358398,1
"Tesla passes $1T valuation on news of Hertz ordering 100,000 cars.","https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/hertz-orders-100000-tesla-cars-bloomberg-news-2021-10-25/

>Oct 25 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) surpassed $1 trillion in market value on Monday after landing its biggest-ever order from rental car company Hertz, a deal that reinforced the electric car leader's ambitions to top the entire auto industry in sales over the next decade.

>Tesla shares surged as much as 14.9% to $1,045.02, making it the world's most valuable automaker according to Reuters calculations based on its latest filing.

>Even Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk expressed surprise at the velocity of the surge. ""Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem,"" Musk tweeted in reply to a comment by Ross Gerber, co-founder of the investment fund Gerber Kawasaki and a Tesla shareholder.

>""Wild $T1mes!"" Musk wrote in a separate tweet.

>Tesla is the first carmaker to join the elite club of trillion-dollar companies that includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).

>Most automakers do not boast about sales to rental car companies, often made at discounts to unload slow-selling models. But for Tesla and its investors, Hertz's decision to order 100,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of 2022 showed electric vehicles are no longer a niche product, but will dominate the mass car market in the near future.

>""Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,"" Hertz interim Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters.

>Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has set an annual sales growth target of 50%, on average, eventually reaching 20 million vehicles a year. That would be more than twice the volume of current sales leaders Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T).

>Consumer demand for electric vehicles is turning a corner in some major markets. The Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe last month, consulting firm JATO Dynamics reported Monday. read more

>Tesla also appeared on Monday to be making progress resolving regulatory problems that threatened its business in China. The company said it had opened a new data and research center in Shanghai to comply with government requirements that data collected from vehicles in China stay in the country. read more

>However, Tesla faced new U.S. regulatory pressure on Monday. The National Transportation Safety Board's new chief sent Musk a letter questioning why Tesla was rolling out its ""Full Self Driving"" software even though the company has not officially responded to the NTSB's questions about the automated driving system's safety.

>""It (the Hertz order) puts an exclamation point under guidance for 50%+ growth in deliveries,"" Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said. ""Another solid piece of evidence EVs are going mainstream.""

>Tesla now faces the daunting day-to-day challenge of becoming a high-volume automaker growing at a rate not seen since the early 1900s when demand exploded for Henry Ford's Model T.

>Tesla is coping with an order backlog for its vehicles and extended supply chain disruptions. Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn cautioned investors during a call last week that Tesla's near-term production goals will hinge on resolving those disruptions and ramping up two new, huge assembly and battery plants in Austin and Berlin. read more

>""There is quite an execution journey ahead of us,"" Kirkhorn said.

>Rivals are not sitting still. Daimler AG's (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz brand, General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N), and startups such as Lucid (LCID.O) and China's Xpeng (9868.HK) are all battling Tesla with new electric cars or trucks.

>Investors and analysts, for now, are looking past the near-term challenges. Morgan Stanley boosted its Tesla price target by 33% to $1,200 as the brokerage expects the electric carmaker to surpass 8 million deliveries in 2030.

>The Hertz deal also underscored the power of the Tesla brand, as the rental car company emerges from bankruptcy and aims to revive its once-dominant brand. Hertz's rescue is led by a group of investors including Knighthead Capital Management, Certares Opportunities and Apollo Capital Management.

>""We absolutely believe that this is going to be competitive advantage for us,"" interim Hertz CEO Mark Fields said of the Tesla order, due to be delivered by the end of 2022.

>""We want to be a leader in mobility. ... Getting customers experience with electrified vehicles is an absolute priority for us.""

>Tesla's cheapest Model 3 sedan starts at about $44,000, making this order worth about $4.4 billion, if the entire order were for its mass-market sedan.

>Fields declined to say how much Hertz was paying for the order. Tesla was not immediately available for comment.

>With the current order, Hertz said EVs will make up more than 20% of its global fleet. Fields cited the rising number of EVs for sale and consumer interest in electrified vehicles.

>Hertz also said it was installing thousands of chargers throughout its network. Customers who rent a Tesla Model 3 will have access to 3,000 Tesla supercharging stations throughout the United States and Europe.

>Tesla shares closed up 12.7% at $1,024.86.

50k in an ETF or 50k in MSFT/GOOG,"Hi all,

I know we may see more downside over the coming months but I’m not expecting to time the bottom perfectly. I want to park some cash and I’m unsure of what the optimum pick is. 

I’ve been looking at QQQ and VOO and VTI and VGT. I plan to park the 50k for 10 years and add smaller increments in the coming years when possible. Is there very little difference in these choices over 10 years? 

Or should I just buy MSFT or GOOG?

Any suggestions and thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit. **How can I use this list?** The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits.

Warren Buffett built a $107 billion net worth through investing. Every year since 1965 he’s written an annual letter showing us how he did it.,"**Here are 10 investing lessons from Warren Buffett:**

**1. What you own**  
What and how you invest matters.  
Buffett focuses on businesses with great management and economic advantages.  
The key word is business.  
Buffett isn’t a stock picker.  
He calls himself a business picker.

&#x200B;

**2. Diversification**  
Just because you’re diversified doesn’t mean you have less risk.  
And just because you have a concentrated position doesn’t mean you have more risk.  
Concentrating on a few stocks can decrease your risk if it means you’ll pay more attention to the business.

&#x200B;

**3. Market pricing**  
Buffett says a stock price shouldn’t determine whether you buy or sell.  
In the short term, people vote with their dollars on which stocks will do well.  
In the long term, stocks with the most value tend to do well.

&#x200B;

**4. Be greedy when others are fearful**  
When money is cheap, hold on to it.  
When money is expensive, invest it.  
Every so often doom and gloom will hit the stock market.  
This is your chance to run towards it with wads of cash.  
Instead of running away with pennies on the dollar.

&#x200B;

**5. Buy businesses that reinvest in themselves**  
If it’s a great company, with great management, and great profits…  
Why wouldn’t they reinvest in themselves?  
This creates an element of compound interest.  
Except instead of your returns compounding, it’s business operations.

&#x200B;

**6. Prioritize moat**  
If a business model produces high profits, there will be competition.  
Businesses that thrive like this have one thing in common:  
A moat.  
A moat doesn’t only keep them profitable, but it keeps them in competition long term.  
This is crucial for investors.

&#x200B;

**7. Buy boring businesses**  
Especially if they sell products/services people need.  
Boring businesses provide stability and longevity to your portfolio.  
This allows you to make money for longer periods of time.

&#x200B;

**8. Invest like a sloth**  
“For investors as a whole, returns decrease as motions increase.”  
Most investors would make more money if they bought and held instead of buying and trading.  
This applies to rebalancing too.  
Here’s what I mean…

&#x200B;

**9. Rebalancing your portfolio**  
Most people trim a position once it gets large.  
Buffett does the opposite.  
Selling positions that have become too big is the same as the bulls trading Michael Jordan because he’s become too good.  
Don’t sell your winners.  
Let them run.

&#x200B;

**10. Time and business**  
Time is a friend of great businesses but an enemy of the mediocre.  
Just because a company does well short term doesn’t mean it’s sustainable.  
“When the tide goes out, you’ll see who’s been swimming naked.”  
This isn't just investors.  
It's businesses too.",investing,MSFT,"Warren Buffett built a $107 billion net worth through investing.

Comparing MSFT's growth rate, P/S and P/E to Google's and Facebooks, I can't help but notice both Google and Facebook have significantly higher sales growth and lower P/E's and P/S's.

Beating on the next AAPL/MSFT,"I’ve been thinking about gambling on new AI companies that are just starting out with lots of risk and huge potential upside. 

Apple’s all time gain is roughly 167,000%; Microsoft’s is roughly 406,000%.

Let’s say I took $1000 and divided it among 100 companies just starting out in AI at $10 each. Then I hold for 40 years and watch most go bankrupt. If 1 of them is the next Apple then $10 turns into $1.7mil.

Palantir $PLTR is extremely overpriced.,"**1. Valuation Metrics Are Sky-High**  
Palantir currently trades at a Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio of approximately 53.13, significantly higher than industry peers.

[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ps-ratio/PLTR) Even for a growth company, this level of valuation is extreme and implies future growth rates that may be unattainable.



**2. Revenue Growth Isn’t Scaling as Expected**  
While Palantir’s revenue growth has been solid, it’s showing signs of deceleration:

* FY 2022: 24% year-over-year growth
* FY 2023 (projected): 18% year-over-year growth

This deceleration doesn’t justify its premium valuation. Additionally, the company remains heavily reliant on government contracts, which are often lumpy and unpredictable.

**3. Profitability Is Still Questionable**  
Despite boasting about achieving GAAP profitability recently, Palantir has heavily relied on stock-based compensation (SBC). In fact, SBC accounted for approximately 30% of their operating expenses last quarter, which dilutes shareholder value and raises questions about true profitability.

**4. AI Hype Is Inflating the Bubble**  
The market has been overly optimistic about Palantir’s AI capabilities. While their AI Platform (AIP) sounds promising, actual adoption metrics and revenue contribution from AIP remain vague. It’s easy to talk AI; it’s harder to monetize it sustainably.

**5. Insider Selling Signals Lack of Confidence**  
Executives have been offloading shares at a significant rate. For instance, Chairman Peter Thiel sold a substantial portion of his holdings recently.

[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-lead-sell-palantir-stock-223000919.html)If the leadership team doesn’t see long-term upside at these prices, why should we?



**6. Competitive Pressure Is Mounting**  
Palantir operates in a crowded space with competitors like Snowflake ($SNOW), Databricks, and Microsoft ($MSFT) offering similar or better solutions. Palantir’s dependence on government clients limits its commercial reach in comparison.

**TL;DR:**  
Palantir is an interesting company with solid tech, but the stock price is disconnected from fundamentals. High valuations, slowing growth, heavy SBC, and reliance on government contracts make $PLTR a risky bet at current levels. AI hype has driven the price into bubble territory, and insiders don’t seem confident in its future.

What do you think? Is $PLTR worth its valuation, or are we seeing another overhyped tech bubble? Let’s discuss! 👇

Competitive Pressure Is Mounting** Palantir operates in a crowded space with competitors like Snowflake ($SNOW), Databricks, and Microsoft ($MSFT) offering similar or better solutions. Palantir’s dependence on government clients limits its commercial reach in comparison. **TL;DR:** Palantir is an interesting company with solid tech, but the stock price is disconnected from fundamentals. High valuations, slowing growth, heavy SBC, and reliance on government contracts make $PLTR a risky bet at current levels. AI hype has driven the price into bubble territory, and insiders don’t seem confident in its future. What do you think? Is $PLTR worth its valuation, or are we seeing another overhyped tech bubble?

"Microsoft ($725.09 B) just surpassed Alphabet/Google ($724.96 B) and Amazon ($697.84 B) in market cap, and with augmented reality, cloud computing, and the Surface lineup, MSFT is a BUY","Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Amazon are neck and neck these days when it comes to technology and market cap. Out of the four of them, Microsoft looks like the most solid buy, and not just because they’re the only American company aside from J&J to have a AAA credit rating.

Apple is a victim of its own success. The iPhone X will reportedly be discontinued due to it’s unjustifiably large thousand dollar+ price tag and lagging sales. Which is why the gold iPhone X was never introduced and the Product Red iPhone 8 is being promoted instead. Apple has invented nothing impressive after Jobs’ passing. The Apple Watch is a flop with apps being removed including Instagram, Amazon, Google Maps, EBay, Slack, and more, most likely due to a lack of use. Now the flip side to the argument as to why you should invest in AAPL is that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is invested in Apple, and as of this writing AAPL is actually their largest holding. Buffett’s reasoning because Apple has a large “moat” meaning that consumer loyalty to the brand is super impressive. But with HomePod completely missing the targets and being a thorough disappointment with an inept Siri and again super high price tag, Apple is pushing the limits on what it can get away with. Maybe the Oracle of Omaha sees something I don’t, but when I want to see the cutting edge in technology I go to the Microsoft Store to test out Hololens, not see another iteration of the iPad Pro which now supports Pencil.

Google is a mixed bag with awesome strengths as well as warning signs it may just be a follower in the industry, and not a good one at that. The strengths of Google are that it still has a monopoly on search, its maps apps (Maps, Waze, Earth) are unrivaled, and it is dominating the classroom with its free online productivity suite of Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Not to mention the fact that YouTube is unrivaled, Google Chrome is unrivaled, and Android is unrivaled when it comes to an iOS alternative. The weaknesses of Google is that they sometimes have no idea what they are doing and fail spectacularly. Google Glass was creepy. Google Plus was lame. Google Nexus went nowhere. And even though Android is breaking record numbers as the world’s most popular OS, Google still clings to their vision of a webpage-centric OS in their flailing ChromeOS. So flailing in fact that they had to suck some energy from Android and make Android apps compatible with ChromeOS.

Amazon is a company I hate with a passion. They abuse their warehouse workers, Jeff Bezos is the richest person on the planet yet he refuses to donate to charity nor conduct interviews except for maybe one by his brother, and this hunger games Amazon is having cities do to impress them for a second headquarters is just messed up and totally fake (Boston is still in the running and they explicitly said they’re offering jack shit with regard to tax breaks). Plus reports are coming in that Whole Foods is being ruined from within: upper management has left, suppliers have left after fees were increased, produce is lagging in quality for the first time, stores are forced to become more centralized and less locally involved, and shelves are deliberately being left empty because of a new system of stocking which may be more efficient but looks awful. Can’t wait for Amazon to fail on this one just like they did with their Fire Phone.

Microsoft is by far the most impressive tech company on this list. Their hardware is top notch, making them safe in an era where companies who make their money on data, like Facebook and Google, are caught in the crosshairs of public perception and backlash. Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella is a thoroughly impressive individual who has worked at Microsoft for decades, is humble as well as decisive, and seems to be ready to cut tech that isn’t working for the company while fostering growth and innovation for sectors of the company that have potential or are currently working well. Microsoft Stores are opening up and introducing people to innovative tech straight from the company itself.

In summary I’d say that Microsoft is going to continue to trend upwards, Google’s fate is in their own hands, Apple is not going anywhere better, and Amazon will continue to slide.

To give some perspective:

* 50 years old

* Graduated from a no-name college with a business degree (paid my own way, had about $20,000 in student loans when I graduated)

* First year out of college made $21,000.  Was at $58,000 when I was 29.  Highest year was about $125,000, but have averaged around $100,000 for the past 10 years.

* Pretty much all from putting as much as I could manage, or was permitted, into 401K and IRAs.  About 65% of the total is traditional retirement, 30% ROTH, and 5% non-retirement.

* I bought cheap used cars when I was under 25.  But then bought a new car and drove it for 20 years.

* The only ""bonus"" along the way was I had a job that I got 6 months severance (around $35,000) and got another job right away, so I had ""double income"" for that 6 months.

* 100% self-managed, primarily through an E*Trade account.

* I pretty much buy and just let it sit.  Last time I sold anything was about 3 years ago when I last rebalanced.  I held all through the 2009 recession and lost about 60%.  I've always invested pretty aggressively, so I got hit hard when it went down, but I've recovered well as it's gone up.

* I pretty much focus on mutual funds now after getting my ass handed to me on individual stocks a few times.  The few I have left are ""sentimental"".  The SIRI and MSFT I've owned since 2001.  The FB I bought in the IPO.  BABA was bought shortly after the IPO.

* I opened my first brokerage account with $2,000 in Ameritrade in 1997 thinking I was going to jump on the internet bubble.  I bought and sold weekly and rode that baby down.  I basically never made any money, and when the whole thing crashed, my $2,000 literally got down to like $37.  So many internet stocks that just evaporated.

Cathie Wood has everyone fooled with her 5 year plans,"
One of the most interesting rebuttals to bears pointing out the obvious flaws and bad price action in ARK is “buy the dip because Cathie Wood said this is a 5 year plan”. This sounds great in theory and probably calms the bag holders at night, but realistically it’s horrible advice. 

In 2000 dot com bubble, people who were buying every stock with dot com at the end probably thought it was a good idea. In fact, when the bubble popped and many investors kept averaging down, they probably had the same thought. It’ll go back up in 5 years anyways, right? Wrong. From the peak of the tech bubble, it took the NASDAQ nearly 12 years to return back to where it was. Even if you picked the top of the cream, let’s say Microsoft - MSFT did not return to its peak 2000 price again until 2010. So, saying everything is a 5 year plan and you’ll be a millionaire in 2026 is great, until you’re stuck holding a stock or in this case, ETF, for 10 years in the red. 

What makes all of this worse is that Cathie Wood trades daily. One of the reason indexes tend to go up is because the winners tend to occupy larger and larger percentages of the index over time. For example, there could be a company today that’s only a small percentage of the index but if the company continues to perform strongly and the stock goes up, it becomes a larger portion of the index, thus benefiting the index holder. But Cathie doesn’t let that natural process take place. She constantly sells Tesla on up days to dilute her funds with other stocks, that may not be nearly as strong. This destroys the entire purpose of a 5 year plan. 

Buyer beware on ARK and if you’re a bag holder, probably a good idea to sell.

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

TheStreet score The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([ I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.* # 2. Zacks Rank It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares.

Microsoft ($MSFT) DD - Sitting on a gold mine,"Hi guys!

Today I'm going to be covering a massive tech-giant called Microsoft. They have a market cap of 1.74T and are the second-largest company in the US. I'm going to do a deep-dive into the fundamentals and catalysts that could make Microsoft a good buy. As always, a TL;DR is at the bottom and if you have any companies you want to see me do a DD on, leave them in the comments.

**Business**

Microsoft is a well-known diversified technology company. Most consumers are familiar with their windows operating system, which has a 75% desktop OS market share as of 2020 ***\[1\]***, their Microsoft Surface Laptop, which they've advertised aggressively, and their Office 365 productivity suite, which is commonly used in schools and businesses alike.

Their operations can be broken up into 3 broad categories: Productivity and Business Processes (32.44% of revenue),  Intelligent Cloud (33.82% of revenue), and Personal Computing (33.74% of revenue). Let's break these segments down!

**Productivity and Business Processes**

This segment includes Microsoft's Office product line, LinkedIn, and Dynamics.

Office saw stellar growth during the pandemic. In Microsoft's 10-K filed in June of 2020, we can see that Office revenue grew by 4.5B or 15%. Office accounts for 64.63% of this segment's revenue. I don't see all that much future growth potential here. Google's productivity suite will cut into margins and makes the moat here very small. While Office Commercial could be alright, Office Consumer will probably get blown out of the water by Google's free product offering.

LinkedIn is another pandemic out-performer. This product grew revenue 1.3B or 20% in 2020 and currently accounts for 14% of this segment's revenue. There's a lot of unrealized potential here and I want to go a little in-depth here because I think this is overlooked by a lot of people.

Think about the amount of data LinkedIn has for a second. You **willingly** enter in: your current place of residence, your age, your current place of work, your past working experience, your prior education, your interests, what skills you have, etc. This is a data *GOLDMINE.* All the information Google spends billions on developing algos to infer about you is offered up to Microsoft by over 740 million members **\[2\]**. If Microsoft identifies this as an opportunity they'd be willing to pursue, it could be huge.

Finally, there's Microsoft Dynamics. I feel so-so about this product. It has fierce competitors who dominate the entire CRM industry (namely Salesforce with 19%+ market share), and I just don't think they have a superior offering here.

**Intelligent Cloud**

This is what many people end up talking about the most when it comes to Microsoft. As someone with a pretty decent amount of cloud knowledge, I can say with confidence it'll be a two-horse game in the future with AWS and Azure dominating. The problem with AWS is actually the fact that they're a subsidiary of Amazon!

If you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts.

**Personal Computing**

This segment includes Windows OS, the Surface Laptop, Xbox, and their Search engines.

I don't expect that much growth here. Windows will continue to grow by 2-4%, their search engine will probably stagnate (I'm kind of shocked people actually use Edge/Bing), Xbox will continue to lose ground to Playstation, and Surface's growth will slow.

**Business TL;DR**

Future growth will be driven by Azure and perhaps LinkedIn.

**Revenues**

Microsoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft.

Switching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent.

**Margins**

Microsoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.

**Assets/Liabilities**

||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B|

Microsoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good.

It's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus.

**Free Cash Flow/Buybacks**

As of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends ***\[3\]*** and has netted shareholders billions.

**Price Ratios/Other**

|Ratio|Microsoft|Apple|Google|Amazon|""Good Value"" for Sector|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio (TTM)|34.33x|32.50x|34.53x|73.62x|<30x|
|P/B Ratio|13.34x|30.42x|6.14x|16.58x|<7x|
|P/S Ratio|11.78x|7.28x|8.17x|4.11x|<7x|
|P/FCF Ratio|35.79x|26.53x|34.75x|51.15x|<30x|
|ROE|42.19%|90.59%|19.03%|27.07%|\>25%|
|Leverage|2.5x|4.6x|1.4x|3.4x|Depends|
|3-year revenue growth|48.90%|23.06%|64.66%|116.85%|Depends|

**PE Ratio**

I said a ""good"" number for the sector was under 30x. I usually look for PEs under 15-20x, but you do have to pay for growth. In this section, nobody was under this threshold. Considering we're in a mature bull-market, I can't say I'm surprised. With that being said, Microsoft narrowly beat out Google to have the second-lowest PE at 34.33x.

**P/B Ratio**

I said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 7x. Very high, I know, but keep in mind these are good values for the *technology* sector. That being said, only Google came in under my good value while the rest weren't even close. Microsoft had the second-lowest P/B at 13.34x. So far, not so good.

**P/S Ratio**

I thought a good P/S ratio here would be under 7x (same as the P/B cutoff). This time, we saw both Google and Amazon qualify with Apple narrowly missing the cutoff. Microsoft ended up having the highest P/S ratio at 11.78x. Overall, P/S ratios were actually decent.

**P/FCF Ratio**

I identified under 30x to be a good multiple for this sector. Sadly, we're right back to where we were before, with only Apple qualifying and the rest being pretty far off. Microsoft had the second-worst P/FCF ratio at 35.79x.

**ROE/Leverage/Revenue Growth**

Microsoft: If you're going to have poor price ratios, the least you can do is be efficient at generating capital. A 42.19% ROE while maintaining reasonable leverage considering their revenue growth rate is impressive. This is one area where Microsoft actually looks pretty attractive.

Apple: Not a big fan of the numbers here. They strike me as over-levered and a future slow-grower.

Google: They have the lowest ROE of the bunch, but they're also the least levered. Considering the amount of growth they've had, the only way I could get behind this little leverage would be if management expected stagnation over the coming years.

Amazon: Amazon is very solid in this area. They have a reasonable amount of leverage considering expected future growth and are pretty efficient at generating capital.

Overall, Microsoft is good at generating capital and is well-levered considering expected and past growth rates.

**Moderate DCF Valuation**

Assuming a 15% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 46% EBITDA Margin, Microsoft has an FV of $212.22 (upside of -10.1%).

**Bull Case**

In my bull case, I'm assuming Microsoft successfully monetizes LinkedIn, and Azure growth is faster than expected. I'm assuming a 17% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 47% EBITDA Margin. Using these parameters, I got an FV of $270.80 (14.8% upside).

I think the FV is probably between the current price and this bull case.

**Bear Case**

Don't worry, this won't be a Cathie Wood bear case!

In this scenario, I'm assuming Azure loses market share, and Office growth stagnates. I think fair parameters in this scenario would be a 7% revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 45% EBITDA Margin. In this scenario, I got an FV of $168.89 (-28.4% upside).

I find this bear case highly unlikely. In my opinion, the idea that Azure growth will slow is misguided.

**Risks**

1. **Office loses market share:** I've been talking about this one throughout the DD because I think it's probably a very likely scenario. The average consumer is going to prefer the Google Productivity Suite over Office because it's free and offers products equivalent in quality. If this were to happen, Office Commercial (Office for businesses and schools) would probably remain relatively intact.
2. **Azure gets trounced**: As I said in the previous section, I find this scenario very unlikely. It would require GCP being worth a dang or everyone snuggling up to Amazon. As I said before, a lot of companies won't go with AWS because it would be supporting a competitor and I don't think the people running GCP will be able to get their ducks in a row.
3. **Rotation into Value:** If bond yields were to continue rising rapidly, a flight to safety could ensue that would cause a selloff in tech stocks such as Microsoft.
4. **Regulation:** While I don't see any regulation risk for Microsoft in particular, if any of the FAANG stocks were to get hit with an anti-trust violation, it would send big-cap tech stocks into a tailspin.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

While Microsoft is a great company with large amounts of growth ahead of it, the current valuation is frothy and there isn't enough of a margin of safety to justify an investment.

**Edit:** Hey guys, thanks for all the support. I thought I'd clarify a couple of things and revise some of my statements. First of all, I was totally wrong about Xbox. Gamepass, their acquisitions of IP, and discord integration will be highly beneficial. I apologize for overlooking that. Secondly, I would like to clarify my statements about Office.

I don't see all that much future growth potential here. Google's productivity suite will cut into margins and makes the moat here very small. While Office Commercial could be alright, Office Consumer will probably get blown out of the water by Google's free product offering. LinkedIn is another pandemic out-performer. This product grew revenue 1.3B or 20% in 2020 and currently accounts for 14% of this segment's revenue. There's a lot of unrealized potential here and I want to go a little in-depth here because I think this is overlooked by a lot of people. Think about the amount of data LinkedIn has for a second. You **willingly** enter in: your current place of residence, your age, your current place of work, your past working experience, your prior education, your interests, what skills you have, etc. This is a data *GOLDMINE.* All the information Google spends billions on developing algos to infer about you is offered up to Microsoft by over 740 million members **\[2\]**. If Microsoft identifies this as an opportunity they'd be willing to pursue, it could be huge. Finally, there's Microsoft Dynamics. I feel so-so about this product. It has fierce competitors who dominate the entire CRM industry (namely Salesforce with 19%+ market share), and I just don't think they have a superior offering here. **Intelligent Cloud** This is what many people end up talking about the most when it comes to Microsoft. As someone with a pretty decent amount of cloud knowledge, I can say with confidence it'll be a two-horse game in the future with AWS and Azure dominating. The problem with AWS is actually the fact that they're a subsidiary of Amazon! If you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts. **Personal Computing** This segment includes Windows OS, the Surface Laptop, Xbox, and their Search engines. I don't expect that much growth here. Windows will continue to grow by 2-4%, their search engine will probably stagnate (I'm kind of shocked people actually use Edge/Bing), Xbox will continue to lose ground to Playstation, and Surface's growth will slow. **Business TL;DR** Future growth will be driven by Azure and perhaps LinkedIn. **Revenues** Microsoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft. Switching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent. **Margins** Microsoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised. **Assets/Liabilities** ||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B| Microsoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good. It's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus. **Free Cash Flow/Buybacks** As of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends ***\[3\]*** and has netted shareholders billions. **Price Ratios/Other** |Ratio|Microsoft|Apple|Google|Amazon|""Good Value"" for Sector| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |PE Ratio (TTM)|34.33x|32.50x|34.53x|73.62x|<30x| |P/B Ratio|13.34x|30.42x|6.14x|16.58x|<7x| |P/S Ratio|11.78x|7.28x|8.17x|4.11x|<7x| |P/FCF Ratio|35.79x|26.53x|34.75x|51.15x|<30x| |ROE|42.19%|90.59%|19.03%|27.07%|\>25%| |Leverage|2.5x|4.6x|1.4x|3.4x|Depends| |3-year revenue growth|48.90%|23.06%|64.66%|116.85%|Depends| **PE Ratio** I said a ""good"" number for the sector was under 30x. I usually look for PEs under 15-20x, but you do have to pay for growth. In this section, nobody was under this threshold. Considering we're in a mature bull-market, I can't say I'm surprised. With that being said, Microsoft narrowly beat out Google to have the second-lowest PE at 34.33x. **P/B Ratio** I said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 7x. Very high, I know, but keep in mind these are good values for the *technology* sector. That being said, only Google came in under my good value while the rest weren't even close. Microsoft had the second-lowest P/B at 13.34x. So far, not so good. **P/S Ratio** I thought a good P/S ratio here would be under 7x (same as the P/B cutoff). This time, we saw both Google and Amazon qualify with Apple narrowly missing the cutoff. Microsoft ended up having the highest P/S ratio at 11.78x. Overall, P/S ratios were actually decent. **P/FCF Ratio** I identified under 30x to be a good multiple for this sector. Sadly, we're right back to where we were before, with only Apple qualifying and the rest being pretty far off. Microsoft had the second-worst P/FCF ratio at 35.79x. **ROE/Leverage/Revenue Growth** Microsoft: If you're going to have poor price ratios, the least you can do is be efficient at generating capital. A 42.19% ROE while maintaining reasonable leverage considering their revenue growth rate is impressive. This is one area where Microsoft actually looks pretty attractive. Apple: Not a big fan of the numbers here. They strike me as over-levered and a future slow-grower. Google: They have the lowest ROE of the bunch, but they're also the least levered. Considering the amount of growth they've had, the only way I could get behind this little leverage would be if management expected stagnation over the coming years. Amazon: Amazon is very solid in this area. They have a reasonable amount of leverage considering expected future growth and are pretty efficient at generating capital. Overall, Microsoft is good at generating capital and is well-levered considering expected and past growth rates. **Moderate DCF Valuation** Assuming a 15% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 46% EBITDA Margin, Microsoft has an FV of $212.22 (upside of -10.1%). **Bull Case** In my bull case, I'm assuming Microsoft successfully monetizes LinkedIn, and Azure growth is faster than expected. I'm assuming a 17% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 47% EBITDA Margin. Using these parameters, I got an FV of $270.80 (14.8% upside). I think the FV is probably between the current price and this bull case. **Bear Case** Don't worry, this won't be a Cathie Wood bear case! In this scenario, I'm assuming Azure loses market share, and Office growth stagnates. I think fair parameters in this scenario would be a 7% revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 45% EBITDA Margin. In this scenario, I got an FV of $168.89 (-28.4% upside). I find this bear case highly unlikely. In my opinion, the idea that Azure growth will slow is misguided. **Risks** 1. **Office loses market share:** I've been talking about this one throughout the DD because I think it's probably a very likely scenario. The average consumer is going to prefer the Google Productivity Suite over Office because it's free and offers products equivalent in quality. If this were to happen, Office Commercial (Office for businesses and schools) would probably remain relatively intact. 2. **Azure gets trounced**: As I said in the previous section, I find this scenario very unlikely. It would require GCP being worth a dang or everyone snuggling up to Amazon. As I said before, a lot of companies won't go with AWS because it would be supporting a competitor and I don't think the people running GCP will be able to get their ducks in a row. 3. **Rotation into Value:** If bond yields were to continue rising rapidly, a flight to safety could ensue that would cause a selloff in tech stocks such as Microsoft. 4. **Regulation:** While I don't see any regulation risk for Microsoft in particular, if any of the FAANG stocks were to get hit with an anti-trust violation, it would send big-cap tech stocks into a tailspin. **Conclusion/TL;DR** While Microsoft is a great company with large amounts of growth ahead of it, the current valuation is frothy and there isn't enough of a margin of safety to justify an investment. **Sources** [**\[1\] = Microsoft Windows Figure**]( [**\[2\] = LinkedIn User Number Figure**]( [**\[3\] = Share Buyback/Dividend Comparison**]( **Edit:** Hey guys, thanks for all the support. I thought I'd clarify a couple of things and revise some of my statements. First of all, I was totally wrong about Xbox. Gamepass, their acquisitions of IP, and discord integration will be highly beneficial. I apologize for overlooking that. Secondly, I would like to clarify my statements about Office. I was talking about GS taking market share from Office Consumer NOT Office Commercial. I feel as if many regular people are willing to trade computational power in exchange for not having to pay. As far as I'm concerned, Office Commercial has a mile-long moat with crocodiles in it.",0.12481886916502298,1

"Microsoft (Earnings: $2.23 per share vs. $2.29 expected) (Revenue: $51.87 billion, vs. $52.44 billion as expected)","Microsoft shares fell 3% in extended trading after the software maker reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that failed to reach Wall Street consensus.

Here’s how the company did:

Earnings: $2.23 per share, adjusted, vs. $2.29 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue: $51.87 billion, vs. $52.44 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

During the quarter, Microsoft reduced its quarterly guidance for income and revenue because of changing foreign-exchange rates. CEO Satya Nadella said employees will get pay increases, and the company introduced services to help customers deal with security incidents.

When management lowered earnings expectations, though, it didn’t factor in other issues that could hurt results.

Technology industry researcher Gartner said earlier this month that logistical disruptions in the quarter had dragged down PC shipments, a key input for sales of Windows operating system licenses to device makers. Plus, macroeconomic worries that hurt revenue growth for advertising-driven social-media companies Snap and Twitter could rub off on Microsoft. In 2021 the company generated $10 billion in advertising revenue before traffic-acquisition costs.

Old Microsoft's Incredible Journey,"Reading some more about ChatGPT, I realized how impressive Microsoft's journey has been.

This is a company founded in 1975. It's older than Apple, and almost 50 years old.

It used to be focused entirely on the older technologies of operating systems and shrink-wrapped productivity software.

When the Internet started to emerge as a new technology, Microsoft first dismissed it, then saw it as a threat and tried to [strangle it in the crib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish).

Microsoft then became the underdog in the fight against Google, a much younger, cooler tech company that epitomizes the power and potential of internet technology.

Google evolved to threaten Microsoft's core business, by developing a popular online productivity suite, as well as various types of operating systems, notably Android and ChromeOS.

Conversely, Microsoft was unable to threaten Google's business in return. Its expensive effort, Bing, [largely failed to compete](https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230211_WBC705.png). Google Search emerged from the match a clear victor, the undefeated, and seemingly undefeatable champion.

If Google vs Microsoft was a boxing match, then Microsoft was the tired old former champion taking a beating from the new king, unable to return any significant blows.

Then, _somehow_, **Microsoft reinvented itself**.

Google's actions over the past few weeks, including a [failed ad launch](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/) and [a botched rushed demo](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/in-paris-demo-google-scrambles-to-counter-chatgpt-but-ends-up-embarrassing-itself/), show it scrambling ineffectually to respond to a threat to its core business it should have foreseen and preempted months if not years ago.

Meanwhile, Microsoft is looking very confident, vigorous, dare we say young? It has successfully turned the tables on Google.

This is a company founded in 1975. It's older than Apple, and almost 50 years old. It used to be focused entirely on the older technologies of operating systems and shrink-wrapped productivity software. When the Internet started to emerge as a new technology, Microsoft first dismissed it, then saw it as a threat and tried to [strangle it in the crib]( Microsoft then became the underdog in the fight against Google, a much younger, cooler tech company that epitomizes the power and potential of internet technology. Google evolved to threaten Microsoft's core business, by developing a popular online productivity suite, as well as various types of operating systems, notably Android and ChromeOS. Conversely, Microsoft was unable to threaten Google's business in return. Its expensive effort, Bing, [largely failed to compete]( Google Search emerged from the match a clear victor, the undefeated, and seemingly undefeatable champion. If Google vs Microsoft was a boxing match, then Microsoft was the tired old former champion taking a beating from the new king, unable to return any significant blows. Then, _somehow_, **Microsoft reinvented itself**. From the company that dismissed and then attacked the internet, it managed to build what is currently [the largest cloud services provider by revenue]( While Google, the symbol of internet technology, is lagging far behind, in 3rd place, with its cloud business in the red as of the last quarter.

Microsoft to pay $56 per user on LinkedIn. Is that worth it?,"Microsoft now has approval from all the major States to acquire LinkedIn for $26 Billion (which is it's Market Capital, so makes sense).  
http://smartstocknews.com/29602-microsoft-corporation-msft-gains-eu-antitrust-approval-to-acquire-linkedin-corp-lnkd  
Does that seem fair?  
InkdIn has one of the highest P/E ratios I've ever seen (some my disagree, but I think that P/E is an appropriate way to evaluate risk).  
So I'm curious what MSFT hopes to gain by acquiring LNKD.  
If it's just the userbase then MSFT is paying $56 per user, is that really worth it?  
$26,000,000,000 / 460,000,000 users = ~56 dollars / user.  
I've also seen some sites say MSFT wants LNKD's ""recruitment services"", again I don't see how this helps them.  
I like LinkedIn, but I wouldn't pay $26,000,000,000 for it, why would Microsoft?  

**edit:**  
If Microsoft just wanted to diversify... WHY DIDN'T THEY COMPETE WITH VERIZON FOR YAHOO?  
Verizon got Yahoo for just under $5B.
http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/25/technology/yahoo-verizon-deal-sale
Yahoo does all kinds of stuff. AND they have Tumblr, which in my opinion, is a more successful Social-media app then LinkedIn by far.  
.  
**Edit 2:**  
So I asked the CFO of the company I work for (business major) and he said this...  
>They're an enterprise software provider, and they're buying a social media site that decision makers for their target customers use constantly for business purposes. They'll probably integrate with their own platforms (one drive, new slack clone) to create a whole ecosystem for themselves focused on enterprise social media. They overpaid though.  
They're probably going to turn it into a salesforce competitor, the problem with the price they paid is that no one else would have offered that much

So it sounds like Microsoft has some sort of long term goal, like they're trying to create their own ""full ecosystem"", and this was a very expensive step toward that goal.  
The acquisition still doesn't make sense to me though (like when Facebook bought Oculus to for 2B).   
I truly feel like there's something else at play here, beyond Taxes.  
.  
*Edit 3:**  
>Your CEO is not very well informed, sorry to say. First, the price they paid may be too much, but that is not something that can be said without doing a proper analysis of the company's fundamentals. The company was trading at that price just a few months earlier so saying that they overpaid and therefore the whole market is wrong about Linkedin's price before doing your due dil is a bit presumtuous. Second, Microsoft already has a salesforce competitor, called Dynamics CRM. If framed around the CRM business, the linkedin acquisition makes a lot of sense as it help differentiate Microsoft's offering while at the same time keeps Salesforce from having it. Microsoft has the ecosystem advantage (office 365, azure, dynamics) but this can only go so far if salesforce gets too far ahead with their offering (they are already the clear leaders). Third, I personally think that Satya Nadella is the ultimate CEO and the best one for Microsoft, so I am ready to give him the beneift of the doubt on this one, your boss should probably do the same. I really doubt Satya didn't study this acquisition thoroughly before giving it the go ahead.

Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang (Minecraft) over 6 years later.,"It's almost 6 years since Microsoft went through with the acquisition of Mojang (creators of Minecraft) for $2.5 billion. 

Gamers were pissed and reception to the buyout was mixed. A lot of people have curious as to why Minecraft (an already big game at the time) was worth $2.5 billion. At the time, Minecraft was already insanely popular and was already the most sold PC game of all time. [Annual revenues have shown over $290m](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/built-last-minecraft-model-9788669.html). So why the gigantic inflation of $2.5 billion?

&#x200B;

I will spare you the description of Minecraft as the people who don't know what it is will be in the minority. I think it's important to talk about the concept of what Minecraft was at the time of its creation and how that contributed to its mass following. Minecraft's indie aesthetic and open nature almost allowed the players to create a game that they were looking for. Notch (creator) was very active with the Minecraft community and constantly releasing updates and engaging directly with the players ([This ended up having huge personal consequences for him](http://web.archive.org/web/20140922063257/http://notch.net/2014/09/im-leaving-mojang)). Although this concept is not 100% new, it was the first to really become popular. Notch's openness for Youtube Creators to publish content of them playing his game (something that a lot of developers were against at the time) only increased the reception the game had.

It's common for the video game industry to have games come and go. Hype is a very big thing with video games. So did Microsoft make a $2.5 billion mistake?

As of now, Minecraft has officially topped at 200 million purchases across all their platforms and over 126 million playing monthly. Prices differ per platform but if counted for all platforms at an average of $15 per copy, we can see roughly around $3,000,000,000 revenue.

Outside of the game itself, Minecraft offers a hosted multiplayer model that will let you play with your friends in a hosted cloud-based world. Merchandise is also a huge source of revenue for Minecraft as well. Spinoffs and installation of almost any device have really put Minecraft everywhere.

It's easy to be skeptical over acquisitions this large at the time, but in 2020 Microsoft made an incredibly smart move by purchasing Mojang.

>Oct 25 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) surpassed $1 trillion in market value on Monday after landing its biggest-ever order from rental car company Hertz, a deal that reinforced the electric car leader's ambitions to top the entire auto industry in sales over the next decade.

>Tesla shares surged as much as 14.9% to $1,045.02, making it the world's most valuable automaker according to Reuters calculations based on its latest filing.

>Even Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk expressed surprise at the velocity of the surge. ""Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem,"" Musk tweeted in reply to a comment by Ross Gerber, co-founder of the investment fund Gerber Kawasaki and a Tesla shareholder.

>""Wild $T1mes!"" Musk wrote in a separate tweet.

>Tesla is the first carmaker to join the elite club of trillion-dollar companies that includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).

>Most automakers do not boast about sales to rental car companies, often made at discounts to unload slow-selling models. But for Tesla and its investors, Hertz's decision to order 100,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of 2022 showed electric vehicles are no longer a niche product, but will dominate the mass car market in the near future.

>""Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,"" Hertz interim Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters.

>Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has set an annual sales growth target of 50%, on average, eventually reaching 20 million vehicles a year. That would be more than twice the volume of current sales leaders Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T).

>Consumer demand for electric vehicles is turning a corner in some major markets. The Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe last month, consulting firm JATO Dynamics reported Monday. read more

>Tesla also appeared on Monday to be making progress resolving regulatory problems that threatened its business in China. The company said it had opened a new data and research center in Shanghai to comply with government requirements that data collected from vehicles in China stay in the country. read more

>However, Tesla faced new U.S. regulatory pressure on Monday. The National Transportation Safety Board's new chief sent Musk a letter questioning why Tesla was rolling out its ""Full Self Driving"" software even though the company has not officially responded to the NTSB's questions about the automated driving system's safety.

>""It (the Hertz order) puts an exclamation point under guidance for 50%+ growth in deliveries,"" Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said. ""Another solid piece of evidence EVs are going mainstream.""

>Tesla now faces the daunting day-to-day challenge of becoming a high-volume automaker growing at a rate not seen since the early 1900s when demand exploded for Henry Ford's Model T.

>Tesla is coping with an order backlog for its vehicles and extended supply chain disruptions. Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn cautioned investors during a call last week that Tesla's near-term production goals will hinge on resolving those disruptions and ramping up two new, huge assembly and battery plants in Austin and Berlin. read more

>""There is quite an execution journey ahead of us,"" Kirkhorn said.

>Rivals are not sitting still. Daimler AG's (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz brand, General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N), and startups such as Lucid (LCID.O) and China's Xpeng (9868.HK) are all battling Tesla with new electric cars or trucks.

>Investors and analysts, for now, are looking past the near-term challenges. Morgan Stanley boosted its Tesla price target by 33% to $1,200 as the brokerage expects the electric carmaker to surpass 8 million deliveries in 2030.

>The Hertz deal also underscored the power of the Tesla brand, as the rental car company emerges from bankruptcy and aims to revive its once-dominant brand. Hertz's rescue is led by a group of investors including Knighthead Capital Management, Certares Opportunities and Apollo Capital Management.

>""We absolutely believe that this is going to be competitive advantage for us,"" interim Hertz CEO Mark Fields said of the Tesla order, due to be delivered by the end of 2022.

>""We want to be a leader in mobility. ... Getting customers experience with electrified vehicles is an absolute priority for us.""

>Tesla's cheapest Model 3 sedan starts at about $44,000, making this order worth about $4.4 billion, if the entire order were for its mass-market sedan.

>Fields declined to say how much Hertz was paying for the order. Tesla was not immediately available for comment.

>With the current order, Hertz said EVs will make up more than 20% of its global fleet. Fields cited the rising number of EVs for sale and consumer interest in electrified vehicles.

>Hertz also said it was installing thousands of chargers throughout its network. Customers who rent a Tesla Model 3 will have access to 3,000 Tesla supercharging stations throughout the United States and Europe.

>Tesla shares closed up 12.7% at $1,024.86.

I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit. **How can I use this list?** The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits.

Why almost all of my portfolio is Microsoft,"I appreciate the concept of spreading your risk and not putting all your eggs in one basket.  About 95% of my holdings is only Microsoft.  It's not a 100% solely because it's not an option for my 401K.  This strategy has done me well, and I believe it remains a reasonable risk.  

Why Microsoft?  Are they a good ethical company?  Heck no!  They don't care about you or me.  They hold two monopolies and they're not shy about abusing them.  They hold monopoly on the consumer OS, and they have no qualms shoving it down your throat.  Don't want Windows 10?  Disabled Windows 10 update?  Too bad, you're getting Windows 10.  I've heard a few stories, such as someone teaching a class but couldn't because MS decided to install Windows 10 at that time.  Windows 11 coming soon to a pc near you.

They also have a near monopoly on office productivity apps, but I am seeing Google making some headway.

Microsoft is worldwide.  Not dependent on one economy.  The have customers in government, commercial and consumer.  They have hardware (e.g. surface pc, xbox, etc.), games, and software for all these market segments.  In my opinion they are as diverse as you can get.  Plus, no management fees to hold stock directly (versus ETF/Mutual funds).

Let's look at other top tech brands.

Apple:  Apple gets a premium for their brand.  While they leverage this for a very nice profit margin, this is a single point of failure.  They have to maintain that brand, and it's rare for a company to maintain this over decades.  They could handle 1-2 hits every couple of years (e.g. child labor), but it's still a single point of failure.

Facebook:  They need our privacy rights to be almost non-existent.  As soon as privacy starts getting enforced, a whole huge chunk of their revenue goes away.  They recently took a hit with Apple's privacy changes.  Not sure what would happen if another Cambridge Analytica incident occurs.

Tesla:  It's simply way overpriced stock.  I respect Elon for taking a huge risk with EVs when no one was taking this market seriously, but Tesla's quality is poor, it's super expensive to repair, and they screw over used buyers by making them pay for features that the original buyer already paid for.  I wish the company does well, but even if it does, there are manufacturers who know how to scale production, which I think Tesla still has yet to learn.  As soon as more EVs come online, I think Tesla will struggle to compete.

The above companies make up a significant portion of tech ETFs, which is why I don't want to buy them.

The above is my opinion alone.

Fidelity has just released a paper about Bitcoin and why it should be be considered separately from other digital assets.,"**Why Investors Need to Consider Bitcoin Separately From Other Digital Assets**

[https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/articles/bitcoin-first](https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/articles/bitcoin-first)

Once investors have decided to invest in digital assets, the next question becomes, ""Which one?"" Of course, bitcoin is the most  recognized, first-ever digital asset, but there are hundreds and even  thousands of other digital assets in the ecosystem.

One of the first concerns investors have regarding bitcoin is as the  first digital asset it may be vulnerable to innovative destruction from  competitors (such as the story of MySpace and Facebook). Another common  consideration surrounding bitcoin is whether it offers the same  potential reward or upside as some of the newer and smaller digital  assets that have emerged.

In this paper we propose:

* Bitcoin is best understood as a monetary good, and one of the  primary investment theses for bitcoin is as the store of value asset in  an increasingly digital world.


* Bitcoin is fundamentally different from any other digital asset. No  other digital asset is likely to improve upon bitcoin as a monetary good  because bitcoin is the most (relative to other digital assets) secure,  decentralized, sound digital money and any ""improvement"" will  necessarily face tradeoffs.


* There is not necessarily mutual exclusivity between the success of  the Bitcoin network and all other digital asset networks. Rather, the  rest of the digital asset ecosystem can fulfill different needs or solve  other problems that bitcoin simply does not.


* Other non-bitcoin projects should be evaluated from a different perspective than bitcoin.


* Bitcoin should be considered an entry point for traditional allocators looking to gain exposure to digital assets.


* Investors should hold two distinctly separate frameworks for  considering investment in this digital asset ecosystem. The first  framework examines the inclusion of bitcoin as an emerging monetary  good, and the second considers the addition of other digital assets that exhibit venture capital-like properties.

>The broad market index rose 0.75% to 4,352.34, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.81% to notch its own record at 14,639.33. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 152.82 points to close at 34,786.35. The S&P 500 has now risen for seven consecutive sessions, its longest winning streak since August.

>Solid moves by major tech stocks helped support the overall market on Friday, with shares of Apple and Salesforce rising by nearly 2% and 1.3%, respectively. Microsoft jumped 2.2%.

>For the week, the Nasdaq Composite rose nearly 2%, while the S&P 500 and Dow climbed 1.7% and 1%, respectively. Several sectors closed at record levels on Friday, including tech and health care.

>The economy [added 850,000 jobs last month](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/jobs-report-june-2021.html), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting an addition of 706,000. The print topped the revised 583,000 jobs created in May.  
>  
>“This is a strong report and should be taken as a sign of things to come for an accelerating labor market,” Aberdeen Standard Investments deputy chief economist James McCann said in a note.  
>  
>Angelo Kourkafas, an investment strategist at Edward Jones, said that the report showed solid growth but wouldn’t change the Fed’s policy path, hitting a sweet spot for markets.  
>  
>“I think it was one of these goldilocks-type of reports, because hiring accelerated -- which is a positive sign for the second half and the recovery -- but not so much that it would trigger a reaction of an accelerated timeline for the Federal Reserve to start tapering,” Kourkafas said.  
>  
>In addition to the job gains, average hourly wages rose 0.3% for the month and are up 3.6% year over year, matching expectations.  
>  
>Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said that the report eased concerns about a labor shortage.  
>  
>“I think we also learned that the explanations for the weaker numbers from April and May -- namely that seasonal probably weighing on job growth and probably some impact from the unemployment benefits on labor supply -- that those were pretty good explanations. So I think it was reassuring, in that sense,” Hatzius said on CNBC’s “[Squawk on the Street](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-on-the-street/),” adding that the unemployment rate coming in higher than expected showed that the recovery still had a long way to go.  
>  
>The S&P 500 has now risen in five of the past six weeks, while the Nasdaq has gained in six of the past seven weeks.  
>  
>Even with the recent strength for stocks, market strategists say that uncertainty about the future of the Fed’s asset purchases and the upcoming earnings season could keep stocks from making major gains in the near term.

>“The market is still very much concerned about the Fed’s reaction function,” said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors, adding that he thought there was still a lot of slack in the labor market.

"Stocks that are going to go nuclear, no, literally.","You have seen in recent news that lots of data centers and AI fueled companies are looking for sustainable carbon free energy. That still isn't enough for the likes of amzn, and msft. They need sustainable STABLE energy. Nuclear is the only real option to hit this. Wind and solar energy are not feasible and if we are honest to ourselves, they simply aren't efficient enough. This is why nuclear is needed. 

Many disasters have occured: chernobyl, three mile island, and fukushima to name a few. This has caused the public to have a negative outlook on the technology. Many people believe wrongly that these reactors will destroy the world, when in fact post construction they are some of the safest forms of energy production.

The issue in the past with traditional reactors are that these projects are super fund sites. BILLIONS of dollars, government regulations bloat the cost and balloon the build time. In order to get a new design, the government is the only source. A lengthy billion+ dollar gamble so most build off the last approved design making small improvements. 

Enter SMR's , small modular nuclear reactors. They are extremely small sites in comparison to traditional monstrosities. The safety zone surrounding a SMR set up is limited to the bounds of the actual generator site. This is a big deal because with traditional reactors you have to build out a secured zone 10+ miles around the actual sites perimeter. The costs continuously add up for traditional economies. 

Who is designing SMRS? Tons of people are attempting but it no longer matters. As of 2020, the company NuScale is the only company in the united states with an approved reactor design. Other companies attempting to design and theorize have already gained support from the private industry in most recent history Amazon did so. They are giving money to start ups who are 10+ YEARS behind NuScale in hopes of getting in early.

  
NuScale has lost money year over year but have done amazing at cutting down on costs and bloat reducing their year over year expenses drastically. They have received government assistance already in 2014 (https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/doe-approves-award-carbon-free-power-project), to the tune of 1.4b USD from the DOE which means government relations have already been built. 

They went to deploy and test the reactors by building a 12 module reactor but fear of extra costs and hitting deadlines drove off private investors causing a halt on the project. AND YET NuScale performed relatively well in sustaining its value for a startup that's never made money. They continue to strive for a mid 2025 start to selling and commercializing their product to prove to the world it is safe and possible. I don't really think I need to explain in depth how AI data super centers, mass surveillance, quantum computing, and the general virtualization of everything will continue to drive the demand for stable sustainable energy and how that relates to NuScale.

  
You may ask the following: ""How is this a small risk investment if you're claiming such higher performance?"", ""How are you sure we are going to go nuclear? The coming administration in the US wont be favorable to renewables!"", ""How do you think even if we are it will happen on a short time span?""

  
I have answers. 

  
Even if NuScale goes tits up in debt, has no way of securing contracts, gets beat out my competitors (impossible lol), IT STILL HAS ITS APPROVED DESIGN. That is their (for lack of a better term) trump card. It is worth the 24$ alone depending on who scoops them up to finish the mission. This leads me into the second nuclear stock. To supply this industry uranium will be needed. The government has been looking for a domestic supplier of fuel grade uranium that is ready for enrichment. Sadly, the enrichment game is mostly private holdings can't get in on that public goodness. But Uranium Energy Corp. has been making money moves, aquiring LIQUIDATABLE uranium and hodling it as hard as they can. Increasing mining, storage, and infrastructure capacities. They are ready for the next move. The united states is already trying to bid on BOTH A GenIII+ nuclear reactor(https://www.energy.gov/oced/generation-iii-small-modular-reactor-program), as well as a domestic supplier and enricher of fuel grade uranium(https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-four-contracts-boost-domestic-haleu-supply-and) <-- they have one for Low enriched as well.

The government is cheap and wants to save money. They have made a report investigating the savings made per killowat compared to the incentives given. They found they gave out 50+ billions and made jack shit return. They equated to do the same garbage return rate they'd only have to use 10 billion for the SMR tech coming out if they support the role out. 

Even with trump in office these stocks make sense to invest in for both hodling potential and short term options gamba. The government is already in favor of this, they will do whatever they need to change the public perception Hell, they don't even care., They will executive order whatever they need.  The following are reasons a trump office will help nuclear.

He has already stated that he will slash 4 or however many regulations per passed regulation. This will benefit all industries regardless of how you feel about it on an emotional level. Furthermore he wants a stronger American offense and defense. Putting SMRs into most states after commercial shows its viability will make for an invasion insurance, solar flare insurance, EMP insurance, supernova insurance, etc. SMRs are off grid capable. They can provide direct power hence the stability for data centers. If the grid goes down SMR's keep pumping. The steam they produce in the next generation will be more efficiently harvested for chemical manufacturing of ammonia and other reagents.

Even with a strong want to continue using fossil fuels for trump, all the fossil fuel industries benefit. With the minimal space requirements needed essentially anywhere near any industry center a nuclear reactor could be built. And on the same page, lets talk about the building of this reactor(s) and its module(s).

  
It is a modular system and NuScale has already put thought and money into fabrication plants to create the modular components, as well as invested in what they call E2 centers across the globe to train professionals to work at NuScale reactor sites. They aren't a tech bullshit startup with false promises they are actively confident and preparing for a 3 year explosion into the industry. They have made talks and contracts and centers in eastern europe namely romania, they have done the same in the middle east, they have done the same in africa specifically full blown university support from Ghana(https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ghana-signs-agreement-build-small-nuscale-nuclear-reactor-2024-08-29/). This shit is happening but retail regards still have their head in the sand. I think the big boys are waiting to blow this shit up over night in the coming few years.

  
I bought in at 22 something and it hit almost 26 the other day. UEC is a bit more volatile but in the exact same boat. This isnt a source of uncorrelated returns, these markets are both going online. And if tariffs happen, these people are MOONING. The signs are right in our faces.

FINAL KEY POINTS AND WRAP UP FOR THE TLDREGARDS:



\*\*Nuclear energy is happening short term and already has DOE support.

\*\*\*ONLY ENTITY THAT HAS AN APPROVED SMR DESIGN BY THE NUKE COMITEE IN THE US\*\*\*

\*\*TRUMP SLASHING REGS ++ TARIFFS??\*\*

\*\*UEC MEETS DOE FUTURE GOALS AS DOMESTIC URANIUM SUPPLY\*

Microsoft will show very significant YoY growth starting in Q1 CY2025 earnings. This is due to the changing how they pay their partners who facilitate the transaction of enterprise agreement fees. 

Some background:
There are a few primary ways that Microsoft customers will purchase software. There are many other options as well, but the vast majority of business buy using one of these vehicles:

1. Enterprise Agreement. Typically a 3 year contract for enterprise software licenses. Think Microsoft365, SQL Server, Windows Server, etc. This is a direct agreement between Microsoft and the customer, however a third-party company called an LSP or License Solution Provider facilitates much of the paperwork and advising of the customer on how to buy. There are about a dozen major LSPs in the US (CDW, SHI, and others). There are many more globally. In exchange for this service, the LSP is paid a fee from Microsoft after the transaction for ~3-7% (sometimes more) of the total contract value. 

2. Cloud Solutions Provider (CSP) contract. This is a direct agreement between the customer and a CSP provider. Microsoft is not involved in the transaction with the customer. The customer pays the CSP and the CSP turns around and pays Microsoft for the services. The CSP also does support for the customer instead of Microsoft. This reduces Microsoft’s overhead since the partner handles the billing and support. CSPs make about 2x in fees compared to the same products on an EA. 


3. Purchase in a “pay as you go” from Microsoft with no third party involved. This is rarely done in the business world as you pay list price this way and nobody pays list price for this software. 

Ok so now you understand an EA vs a CSP. Many large tech resellers like CDW are LSPs and make a large chunk of money from both CSP and EA fees. Microsoft pays a shitload. Like billions in EA fees to partners globally each year. **They just announced that they are lowering EA fees for LSPs to .5-.75% across the board.** This will take effect on January 1st and will mean that even if growth is flat (it won’t be) YoY, they’re now retaining billions of dollars that would have been paid out in EA fees. 

This is causing many partners to accelerate their CSP business. This also benefits Microsoft as support for these products now falls on the partner, as does the billing. This means that in either scenario, Microsoft wins. 

Customer stays on EA?  Microsoft now makes 4-6% more on each transaction even before normal cost increases because they only pay the partner .5-.75% now. 

Customer moves to CSP? The partner makes a bit more margin, but Microsoft no longer has to staff support engineers or handle billing with that customer which significantly saves on operational overhead. 

Long Microsoft. Probably don’t short CDW but there are worse things you  could be short on.

I believe Microsoft (MSFT) is prepping Lumen (LUMN) for an acquisition.,"Hello Readers, 

MobyDick4Real here, and I am going to dissect why I believe Microsoft is prepping Lumen Technologies for a acquisition.

To begin, I was a former employee of Lumen Technologies for just under 5 years. I was part of the Federal team, and it was my responsibility to price-to-win RFP's in the communications and technology sector. During my tenure, I was part of the team that secured the IPTS win which is a $1.5B sole contract awarded to Lumen.

During this time, I watched the stock sink from about $15 to less than a dollar, and currently own 4% of the call options expiring January 1st 2026. This may sound like a lot, but its $1,000 worth of $5 strike options. 

Lumens stock has been in steady decline since Jeff Storey took the helm about 5 years ago, but was anchored around $7 due to the ridiculous dividend they were paying ($0.25 a quarter). After his retirement there was internal chatter of whether Laurinda Pang, or Ed Morche was going to replace Jeff during his departure. However, to the companies surprise an outsider was awarded the position and took leadership. 

Kate Johnson is a tenured executive that was previously a Vice President at Microsoft. Her bread and butter was subscription based modeling at Microsoft, and headed major projects. After winning the CEO position at Lumen; Kate slowly fired off all the executives of Lumen besides two people: Andrew Dugan, and Chris Stansbury and proceeded to fill the positions with Microsoft alumni and other colleagues from her days at Warton. 

First thing Kate did was remove the dividend, and sold off Lumens LATAM and EMEA offerings; sizably reducing Lumens debt, and bolstering free cash flow. Bears say that Lumens primary sales are coming from landline phones and other legacy services, and I believe this to be a fallacy.  

Lumen can be easily broken into two major teams that derive most of the large wins. The Hyperscalers team (Enterprise) and the DoD team (Fed). For the sake of this conversation I am going to focus on the Federal team. Lumen was created after a merger between Level3 and CenturyLink. Where CenturyLink focused on enterprise sales, and Level3 ran the majority of the DoD network. 

Microsoft has recently bolstered their view on supporting government contracts, and has done so by crafting Zero Trust infrastructure into their cloud offerings, and getting Teams on just about every government computer there is. 

My hypothesis is Microsoft wants to further their hold in the defense sectors and plans to do so by acquiring Lumen. Lumen is a consortium member of every large undersea cable and provides most of the layer 1 transport to the government. Having Microsoft purchase Lumen immediately puts them in a position to win massive multi-billion dollar contracts, and overlay their technology as a value add. This then provides the government with an easy button to not only purchase their data infrastructure but to have all the bells and whistles Microsoft provides included seamlessly. If there is one thing I learned working Fed, is that the government loves an easy button. 

Lumens goal for both enterprise and fed is to create a subscription based model referred to as network as a service (NaaS) and this allows their hyperscalers and larger accounts to add and reduce bandwidth across their business within a few clicks. Insert the Queen of subscription based modeling. 

As quantum computing and quantum fiber become more prevalent Lumen is perfectly positioned to have massive growth seizing the workload for all autonomous vehicles, AI, 5G, quantum computing, and any large data transfers across the US. 

Regarding the sell-offs of LATAM and EMEA, the deals were structured that the companies that purchased them (Colt Telecom, and Cirion Telecom) would still supply the company with all required needs on the fiber that was sold. This allows Lumen to be a global business without having to manage their global fiber footprint. 

Lumen is capable of pivoting and creating dense datasets due to the fact they have direct access to 70% of all global internet traffic, and have vision into another 10% through peering agreements. This gives them access to 80% of all global internet traffic. This would dramatically increase Microsofts AI offerings, and could make all their selling efforts more affective. 

By Microsoft purchasing Lumen, their security, AI, government, enterprise, and all data transfer offerings would be dramatically improved based off the information they could feed into it.

Lumen stock is currently sitting around $1.40, and makes about $15-$20B a year with a gross profit of about $7B in 2023. The business has been in decline profit wise for about 5 years, but this is due to major sell-offs and securing future business. 

For the reasons of Microsoft executives taking the helm, cutting off the deadweight sectors, rumors of the merger in the industry, and the overlap between the two companies. I believe Microsoft is likely to purchase Lumen for pennies on the dollar in the upcoming years. 

But who knows, maybe I'm just regarded.

Bears say that Lumens primary sales are coming from landline phones and other legacy services, and I believe this to be a fallacy. Lumen can be easily broken into two major teams that derive most of the large wins. The Hyperscalers team (Enterprise) and the DoD team (Fed). For the sake of this conversation I am going to focus on the Federal team. Lumen was created after a merger between Level3 and CenturyLink. Where CenturyLink focused on enterprise sales, and Level3 ran the majority of the DoD network. Microsoft has recently bolstered their view on supporting government contracts, and has done so by crafting Zero Trust infrastructure into their cloud offerings, and getting Teams on just about every government computer there is. My hypothesis is Microsoft wants to further their hold in the defense sectors and plans to do so by acquiring Lumen. Lumen is a consortium member of every large undersea cable and provides most of the layer 1 transport to the government. Having Microsoft purchase Lumen immediately puts them in a position to win massive multi-billion dollar contracts, and overlay their technology as a value add. This then provides the government with an easy button to not only purchase their data infrastructure but to have all the bells and whistles Microsoft provides included seamlessly. If there is one thing I learned working Fed, is that the government loves an easy button. Lumens goal for both enterprise and fed is to create a subscription based model referred to as network as a service (NaaS) and this allows their hyperscalers and larger accounts to add and reduce bandwidth across their business within a few clicks. Insert the Queen of subscription based modeling. As quantum computing and quantum fiber become more prevalent Lumen is perfectly positioned to have massive growth seizing the workload for all autonomous vehicles, AI, 5G, quantum computing, and any large data transfers across the US. Regarding the sell-offs of LATAM and EMEA, the deals were structured that the companies that purchased them (Colt Telecom, and Cirion Telecom) would still supply the company with all required needs on the fiber that was sold. This allows Lumen to be a global business without having to manage their global fiber footprint. Lumen is capable of pivoting and creating dense datasets due to the fact they have direct access to 70% of all global internet traffic, and have vision into another 10% through peering agreements. This gives them access to 80% of all global internet traffic. This would dramatically increase Microsofts AI offerings, and could make all their selling efforts more affective. By Microsoft purchasing Lumen, their security, AI, government, enterprise, and all data transfer offerings would be dramatically improved based off the information they could feed into it. Lumen stock is currently sitting around $1.40, and makes about $15-$20B a year with a gross profit of about $7B in 2023. The business has been in decline profit wise for about 5 years, but this is due to major sell-offs and securing future business. For the reasons of Microsoft executives taking the helm, cutting off the deadweight sectors, rumors of the merger in the industry, and the overlap between the two companies. I believe Microsoft is likely to purchase Lumen for pennies on the dollar in the upcoming years. But who knows, maybe I'm just regarded. &;",0.14620039682539682,1

I believe Microsoft (MSFT) is prepping Lumen (LUMN) for an acquisition.,"Hello Readers, 

MobyDick4Real here, and I am going to dissect why I believe Microsoft is prepping Lumen Technologies for a acquisition.

To begin, I was a former employee of Lumen Technologies for just under 5 years. I was part of the Federal team, and it was my responsibility to price-to-win RFP's in the communications and technology sector. During my tenure, I was part of the team that secured the IPTS win which is a $1.5B sole contract awarded to Lumen.

During this time, I watched the stock sink from about $15 to less than a dollar, and currently own 4% of the call options expiring January 1st 2026. This may sound like a lot, but its $1,000 worth of $5 strike options. 

Lumens stock has been in steady decline since Jeff Storey took the helm about 5 years ago, but was anchored around $7 due to the ridiculous dividend they were paying ($0.25 a quarter). After his retirement there was internal chatter of whether Laurinda Pang, or Ed Morche was going to replace Jeff during his departure. However, to the companies surprise an outsider was awarded the position and took leadership. 

Kate Johnson is a tenured executive that was previously a Vice President at Microsoft. Her bread and butter was subscription based modeling at Microsoft, and headed major projects. After winning the CEO position at Lumen; Kate slowly fired off all the executives of Lumen besides two people: Andrew Dugan, and Chris Stansbury and proceeded to fill the positions with Microsoft alumni and other colleagues from her days at Warton. 

First thing Kate did was remove the dividend, and sold off Lumens LATAM and EMEA offerings; sizably reducing Lumens debt, and bolstering free cash flow. Bears say that Lumens primary sales are coming from landline phones and other legacy services, and I believe this to be a fallacy.  

Lumen can be easily broken into two major teams that derive most of the large wins. The Hyperscalers team (Enterprise) and the DoD team (Fed). For the sake of this conversation I am going to focus on the Federal team. Lumen was created after a merger between Level3 and CenturyLink. Where CenturyLink focused on enterprise sales, and Level3 ran the majority of the DoD network. 

Microsoft has recently bolstered their view on supporting government contracts, and has done so by crafting Zero Trust infrastructure into their cloud offerings, and getting Teams on just about every government computer there is. 

My hypothesis is Microsoft wants to further their hold in the defense sectors and plans to do so by acquiring Lumen. Lumen is a consortium member of every large undersea cable and provides most of the layer 1 transport to the government. Having Microsoft purchase Lumen immediately puts them in a position to win massive multi-billion dollar contracts, and overlay their technology as a value add. This then provides the government with an easy button to not only purchase their data infrastructure but to have all the bells and whistles Microsoft provides included seamlessly. If there is one thing I learned working Fed, is that the government loves an easy button. 

Lumens goal for both enterprise and fed is to create a subscription based model referred to as network as a service (NaaS) and this allows their hyperscalers and larger accounts to add and reduce bandwidth across their business within a few clicks. Insert the Queen of subscription based modeling. 

As quantum computing and quantum fiber become more prevalent Lumen is perfectly positioned to have massive growth seizing the workload for all autonomous vehicles, AI, 5G, quantum computing, and any large data transfers across the US. 

Regarding the sell-offs of LATAM and EMEA, the deals were structured that the companies that purchased them (Colt Telecom, and Cirion Telecom) would still supply the company with all required needs on the fiber that was sold. This allows Lumen to be a global business without having to manage their global fiber footprint. 

Lumen is capable of pivoting and creating dense datasets due to the fact they have direct access to 70% of all global internet traffic, and have vision into another 10% through peering agreements. This gives them access to 80% of all global internet traffic. This would dramatically increase Microsofts AI offerings, and could make all their selling efforts more affective. 

By Microsoft purchasing Lumen, their security, AI, government, enterprise, and all data transfer offerings would be dramatically improved based off the information they could feed into it.

Lumen stock is currently sitting around $1.40, and makes about $15-$20B a year with a gross profit of about $7B in 2023. The business has been in decline profit wise for about 5 years, but this is due to major sell-offs and securing future business. 

For the reasons of Microsoft executives taking the helm, cutting off the deadweight sectors, rumors of the merger in the industry, and the overlap between the two companies. I believe Microsoft is likely to purchase Lumen for pennies on the dollar in the upcoming years. 

But who knows, maybe I'm just regarded.

&#x200B;",wallstreetbets,Microsoft,"I believe Microsoft (MSFT) is prepping Lumen (LUMN) for an acquisition. Hello Readers, MobyDick4Real here, and I am going to dissect why I believe Microsoft is prepping Lumen Technologies for a acquisition. To begin, I was a former employee of Lumen Technologies for just under 5 years. I was part of the Federal team, and it was my responsibility to price-to-win RFP's in the communications and technology sector. During my tenure, I was part of the team that secured the IPTS win which is a $1.5B sole contract awarded to Lumen. During this time, I watched the stock sink from about $15 to less than a dollar, and currently own 4% of the call options expiring January 1st 2026. This may sound like a lot, but its $1,000 worth of $5 strike options. Lumens stock has been in steady decline since Jeff Storey took the helm about 5 years ago, but was anchored around $7 due to the ridiculous dividend they were paying ($0.25 a quarter). After his retirement there was internal chatter of whether Laurinda Pang, or Ed Morche was going to replace Jeff during his departure. However, to the companies surprise an outsider was awarded the position and took leadership. Kate Johnson is a tenured executive that was previously a Vice President at Microsoft. Her bread and butter was subscription based modeling at Microsoft, and headed major projects. After winning the CEO position at Lumen; Kate slowly fired off all the executives of Lumen besides two people: Andrew Dugan, and Chris Stansbury and proceeded to fill the positions with Microsoft alumni and other colleagues from her days at Warton. First thing Kate did was remove the dividend, and sold off Lumens LATAM and EMEA offerings; sizably reducing Lumens debt, and bolstering free cash flow. Bears say that Lumens primary sales are coming from landline phones and other legacy services, and I believe this to be a fallacy. Lumen can be easily broken into two major teams that derive most of the large wins. The Hyperscalers team (Enterprise) and the DoD team (Fed). For the sake of this conversation I am going to focus on the Federal team. Lumen was created after a merger between Level3 and CenturyLink. Where CenturyLink focused on enterprise sales, and Level3 ran the majority of the DoD network. Microsoft has recently bolstered their view on supporting government contracts, and has done so by crafting Zero Trust infrastructure into their cloud offerings, and getting Teams on just about every government computer there is.

'Cisco replaces Microsoft as world's most valuable company' 3/25/2001,"went back to check out headlines from the cisco era. was struck by how similar the discourse is. food for thought. 



Cisco overtaking Microsoft ""certainly validates the networked economy that Cisco is revolutionising,"" said Brian Goodstadt, an analyst with the Standard & Poor Equity Group.

Microsoft, while still a strong generator of corporate profits, generates much of its income from desktop applications and operating systems. While the Internet has boosted demand for Microsoft's products, Cisco, whose routers carry most of the traffic running over the network, is seen as a bigger beneficiary of its growth and its earnings gains have far outpaced Microsoft in recent quarters.

Quite possibly, Cisco Systems, the biggest maker of equipment that powers the Internet, will become for the Internet what Microsoft Corp, the biggest software company, was for the personal computer.

Judging by Cisco's market capitalisation, investors seem to believe that Cisco could become the technology standard bearer for Internet hardware. Microsoft, which was founded in 1975 and went public 11 years later, took 24 years to become the company investors value the most, but occupied that spot for less than one year. Analysts have said Cisco, which was founded in 1984 and went public in 1986, will likely remain top dog for much longer and has a shot at becoming the first firm ever to be worth $1 trillion.

Additionally, Microsoft's recent $68.7B acquisition of Activision Blizzard will play a role in next quarter's earnings.

The company is heavily investing in AI, with CEO Satya Nadella emphasizing its integration across the company’s tech stack. 

This commitment to AI has led to the launch of generative AI-powered Copilot apps for various Microsoft products, designed to boost productivity.

Microsoft previously indicated that AI would not yield significant results until after the start of 2024. 

However, Azure's growth is already being influenced by generative AI, helping to outpace expectations. 

Overall, the company anticipates a sales increase of up to 8.7% in the upcoming quarter, surpassing analyst forecasts.

Get in on Uranium Now,"**Since 2020, the price of uranium has gone from $21/lb to a high of $106/lb in Feb 2024. The price has experienced a slight pull back since then to $83/lb. I believe this 4-5x change in the price of uranium to be small compared to what lies ahead, and I will explain the reasons why in this paper.** 

**What is Uranium?**

Uranium is an abundant, radioactive metal naturally occurring in earth's crust. The vast purpose of it today is used for creating nuclear fuel to provide energy. It is one of the cleanest burning fuels and very easy on the environment. Think of Uranium as a gas pump, there are different options you can choose between based on grade. We will focus on the two main isotopes for Uranium. When it is mined, approximately 99.3% is uranium-238 and 0.7% is uranium-235.

U-238 is a critical component of plutonium production which in itself gives a TON of demand. The major application of Uranium in the military sector is depleted Uranium (DU). DU is mostly U-238 after U-235 has been removed. It is used to create armor piercing rounds and military projectiles. The high density of DU makes weapons highly effective. There are other important uses of U-238, such as counterbalancing aircraft, though we are not focusing on those.

U-235 is even more important because for the most part, this is what fuels nuclear reactors. In order to power a nuclear reactor, the concentration of U-235 needs to be 3-5% instead of 0.7%. The higher concentration makes it fissionable, meaning it can power light-water reactors which are the most common reactor design in the USA (United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission). One kilogram (2.2 LBS) of U-235 produces as much energy as 3,306,930 pounds of coal.

**HALEU**

High-assay low-enriched uranium. A crucial material needed to deploy advanced nuclear reactors. Currently, HALEU is not commercially available from US based suppliers. Boosting domestic supply could spur the development of advanced reactors in the US (Energy.gov). In November, the DOE reached a key milestone under its HALEU demonstration project, when a company produced the nation’s first 20 kilograms of HALEU. Thus, providing a first of its kind production in the United States in more than 70 years. Amid growing efforts to secure a reliable domestic nuclear fuel supply, the DOE has awarded contracts to six companies as part of an $800 million initiative to bolster the deconversion of high-assay low-enriched uranium (Roan, 2024).

The existing fleet of US reactors run on enriched uranium up to 5% with U-235. However, most advanced reactors require HALEU which is enriched between 5% to 20% in order to achieve smaller and more versatile designs with the highest standards of safety, security and nonproliferation. HALEU also allows developers to optimize their systems for longer life cores, increased efficiencies, and better fuel utilization. Together, the US, Canada, France, Japan and the UK have announced collective plans to mobilize $4.2 billion in government-led spending to develop safe and secure nuclear energy supply chains (Energy.gov). 

As we now know, enriched uranium is crucial. Although, the enrichment process is very costly. Russia is the biggest player in the enrichment process. They are responsible for roughly 44% of the world’s enrichment capacity and supply approximately 35% of imported nuclear fuel to the US. As of August 12th, 2024, Uranium imports into the USA from Russia are outlawed. This allows $2.7 billion in funding to build out the U.S uranium industry specifically, to increase production of LEU and HALEU. The DOE estimates that US utilities have roughly 3 years of LEU available through existing inventory or pre-existing contracts. To ensure no plants are disrupted, a waiver process is in order to allow some imports of LEU from Russia to continue for a limited time. “In the meantime, we’re taking aggressive steps to establish a secure and reliable uranium supply market” (Energy.gov). 

**Uranium Supply**

Now, the supply that was once held of uranium is running out. “The inventory overhang that was so damaging to the market for almost a decade has been largely consumed, and going forward, we’re going to have an increasing reliance on primary supply” (World Nuclear News). Idled mines are now starting production again, as well as increases in mines under development, and planned mines. “There is no doubt that sufficient uranium resources exist to meet future needs, but producers have been waiting for the market to rebalance before starting to invest in new capacity and bring idled capacity back into operation. This is now happening (World Nuclear News).

The uranium market has been facing a supply deficit for years due to underinvestment. The problem is that uranium mines take a long time and require a ton of capital to get up and running. A mine can take 10-15 years to begin production AFTER they are opened. 

As with other minerals, investment in geological exploration generally results in increased known resources. Over 2005 and 2006, exploration efforts resulted in the world’s known uranium resources increasing by 15% (World Nuclear Association). Therefore, there is no need to anticipate any uranium shortage.The world’s current measured resources of uranium will last about 90 years. This represents a higher level of assured resources than is normal for most minerals. There is nearly limitless supply because most of it has not been discovered due to little investment in mining and exploration. To be clear, although we know this uranium exists, that does not mean it has been mined. 

Primary Supply - This type of supply refers to uranium extracted directly from mining.The primary supply has been under heavy pressure in recent years due to low uranium prices. Low prices lead to reduced mining operations. This is because mining is incredibly expensive and companies won’t do it if there is no good price incentive at which they could sell the uranium. It is forecasted that uranium mining will not meet the reactor demands for at least 15 years. Now, it is also estimated that by 2035, primary uranium production will decrease by 30% due to resource depletion and mine closures. New mines will only be able to compensate for the capacity of the exhausted mines.

Secondary Supply - This refers to all uranium that is not sourced directly from mining but from other inventories and recycled materials. This includes, civil stockpiles, military stockpiles, recycled uranium and enrichment tails. Civil stockpiles (uranium reserves held by utilities, hedge funds, and government) grew immensely after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Many reactors shut down due to the worries surrounding uranium, and investment in the nuclear sector decreased. Due to this, there was a large oversupply of uranium. Since then, these stockpiles have been largely drawn upon to meet reactor demand, instead of relying on primary supply. So, utilities have been relying on their inventory to fuel their reactors, instead of getting fresh uranium from mines. This has caused a gradual depletion of their reserves. There is no mathematical way to rely on reserves anymore. The ONLY option is to produce uranium in order to keep reactors operational, while meeting future demand.

**Uranium Demand** 

The United States, China, and France represent around 58% of global uranium demand. Uranium demand can be characterized as a predictable function of the number of operating nuclear power plants, their capacity factors and fuel burn up levels. As of April 30th, 2024, there are 94 operating nuclear reactors in the United States. The global count of operating nuclear reactors is 440. These account for 9% of the world's electricity. Currently, there are 60 nuclear reactors in production across 16 countries spanning into 2030. About 90 more reactors have been planned and over 300 have been proposed. 

Looking ten years ahead, the uranium market is expected to grow. The 2023 World Nuclear Association’s Nuclear Fuel Report shows a 28% increase in uranium demand over 2023-2030. This same report predicts a 51% increase in uranium demand for the decade 2031-2040. Global demand for electricity may rise 165% by 2050 while at the same time, 101 countries have committed to net-zero carbon emission goals and are actively pursuing a shift to clean energy.

**Uranium Production**

The main producers of uranium are Kazakhstan, Canada, Namibia, Australia, and Uzbekistan. Kazakhstan is the major producer. In 2022, they produced 43% of the world’s uranium. The company Kazatomprom is responsible for the massive production within the country. Very big news came out recently stating they have slashed their production target for 2025 by 17%. This is due to project delays and sulfuric acid shortages (a critical component of uranium extraction). They are expected to produce 25,000-26,500 tonnes of yellowcake (a concentrated form of uranium ore produced during the early stage of processing).This move is likely to continue the upward pressure on uranium prices. This slash in production is occurring while Kazatomprom has their lowest reported uranium inventory levels since 1997 of 4,142 tonnes of uranium, down 31% from the previous year (Dempsey, 2024). “This is a structural problem. It won’t just be the west saying this is an issue for us; it will also be Russia and China saying it’s a problem for our new nuclear power plants” (Nick Lawson, CEO of Ocean Wall). 

Uranium prices have been low for decades due to oversupply and stockpiles. This has made it less appealing to develop new mines and instead, rely on existing mines and supply. However, the US and other countries are showing increased signs of uranium mining at an alarming rate. In the first quarter of 2024, the United States produced more than 82,000 LBS of uranium which is more than the entire 2023 production. In Q2 of  2024, production increased to 97,709 LBS, an 18% increase from Q1 2024. While this increased production is significant for a domestic supply, it does not begin to put a dent in the global deficit. It simply goes to show the US is beginning their own production of uranium.

**United States Uranium Production 2000-2024 Q2 lbs**

In a recent interview with Justin Huhn, a uranium market expert, he stated, “YTD there has been 54 million pounds contracted. Demand pulled back temporarily and when that happened, price kept rising. It's a hugely important indicator that when demand comes back in, which it is starting to, the prices are going higher. We're starting to see early signs of that. Honestly, I think we are on the cusp of a very large movement in the coming weeks. We're going to see a competitive environment for limited supply. That's what is coming next. The ceiling in the contracts tells you where the price is going. The 3 and 5 year forward tells you where the spot is going. Every piece of evidence in the physical market is telling us that prices are going higher.""

""Companies need uranium and they aren't going to not buy it at price xyz. Now, could we get to a point where logically the price of uranium utility does not justify continued operations? That's possible. And unless we have a balanced market, that might be the limiting upside factor. Price would have to be somewhere in the $700s for the average utility to not afford to buy uranium in order to operate their facilities.”

**World Uranium Production vs Reactor Requirements, 1945-2022 tU**

# Conclusion 

Although we’ve seen drastic changes in the price of uranium already, I believe the bull market is just beginning. There is immense demand, and production simply can’t meet the requirements. Prospective mines can take 10-15 years to become operational, while 30% of current mines are estimated to be depleted by 2035. There is not enough time available for the uranium supply to meet the demand despite increases in production. Companies are willing and obligated to secure nuclear fuel at almost any price. Increased investment into nuclear energy is happening from a governmental side and big tech. Amazon, Microsoft and Google have all come out with news recently, investing insane amounts into nuclear. Countries are uniting in the fight against climate change to establish a global supply of clean, zero-carbon energy. Therefore, I believe that as the supply continues to dwindle and demand continues to increase, the fight for uranium that will ensue is going to send the price to levels we have never before seen in history. 

**Investment Ideas**

I think mining companies are best set up to gain from this market. A high uranium price means they earn higher revenues by selling it. This also allows them to further develop mines and explore new areas, increasing overall production. We are in a seller dominated market where prices are based on bidding wars between utilities, governments, and hedge funds. These mining companies are Cameco (CCJ) currently trading at $50.86 and NexGen Energy (NXE) trading at $7.26. I also like the mining ETF Range Nuclear Renaissance Index (NUKZ) trading at $38.31 and Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM) trading at $48.26. The other companies I like in this sector are Clean Harbors, Inc. trading at $257.48 and Constellation Energy (CEG) trading at $265.86. Clean Harbors has a dominant position in the market for the handling and disposal of nuclear waste. They also have very good management. I’d say they are my favorite pick out of the entire sector. Aware that this is WSB, YOLO calls on URNM is the play. This is a chance to create generational wealth.

**This is not financial advice.**",wallstreetbets,Microsoft,"Get in on Uranium Now **Since 2020, the price of uranium has gone from $21/lb to a high of $106/lb in Feb 2024. The price has experienced a slight pull back since then to $83/lb. I believe this 4-5x change in the price of uranium to be small compared to what lies ahead, and I will explain the reasons why in this paper.** **What is Uranium?** Uranium is an abundant, radioactive metal naturally occurring in earth's crust. The vast purpose of it today is used for creating nuclear fuel to provide energy. It is one of the cleanest burning fuels and very easy on the environment. Think of Uranium as a gas pump, there are different options you can choose between based on grade. We will focus on the two main isotopes for Uranium. When it is mined, approximately 99.3% is uranium-238 and 0.7% is uranium-235. U-238 is a critical component of plutonium production which in itself gives a TON of demand. The major application of Uranium in the military sector is depleted Uranium (DU). DU is mostly U-238 after U-235 has been removed. It is used to create armor piercing rounds and military projectiles. The high density of DU makes weapons highly effective. There are other important uses of U-238, such as counterbalancing aircraft, though we are not focusing on those. U-235 is even more important because for the most part, this is what fuels nuclear reactors. In order to power a nuclear reactor, the concentration of U-235 needs to be 3-5% instead of 0.7%. The higher concentration makes it fissionable, meaning it can power light-water reactors which are the most common reactor design in the USA (United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission). One kilogram (2.2 LBS) of U-235 produces as much energy as 3,306,930 pounds of coal. **HALEU** High-assay low-enriched uranium. A crucial material needed to deploy advanced nuclear reactors. Currently, HALEU is not commercially available from US based suppliers. Boosting domestic supply could spur the development of advanced reactors in the US (Energy.gov). In November, the DOE reached a key milestone under its HALEU demonstration project, when a company produced the nation’s first 20 kilograms of HALEU. Thus, providing a first of its kind production in the United States in more than 70 years. Amid growing efforts to secure a reliable domestic nuclear fuel supply, the DOE has awarded contracts to six companies as part of an $800 million initiative to bolster the deconversion of high-assay low-enriched uranium (Roan, 2024). The existing fleet of US reactors run on enriched uranium up to 5% with U-235. However, most advanced reactors require HALEU which is enriched between 5% to 20% in order to achieve smaller and more versatile designs with the highest standards of safety, security and nonproliferation. HALEU also allows developers to optimize their systems for longer life cores, increased efficiencies, and better fuel utilization. Together, the US, Canada, France, Japan and the UK have announced collective plans to mobilize $4.2 billion in government-led spending to develop safe and secure nuclear energy supply chains (Energy.gov). As we now know, enriched uranium is crucial. Although, the enrichment process is very costly. Russia is the biggest player in the enrichment process. They are responsible for roughly 44% of the world’s enrichment capacity and supply approximately 35% of imported nuclear fuel to the US. As of August 12th, 2024, Uranium imports into the USA from Russia are outlawed. This allows $2.7 billion in funding to build out the U.S uranium industry specifically, to increase production of LEU and HALEU. The DOE estimates that US utilities have roughly 3 years of LEU available through existing inventory or pre-existing contracts. To ensure no plants are disrupted, a waiver process is in order to allow some imports of LEU from Russia to continue for a limited time. “In the meantime, we’re taking aggressive steps to establish a secure and reliable uranium supply market” (Energy.gov). **Uranium Supply** Now, the supply that was once held of uranium is running out. “The inventory overhang that was so damaging to the market for almost a decade has been largely consumed, and going forward, we’re going to have an increasing reliance on primary supply” (World Nuclear News). Idled mines are now starting production again, as well as increases in mines under development, and planned mines. “There is no doubt that sufficient uranium resources exist to meet future needs, but producers have been waiting for the market to rebalance before starting to invest in new capacity and bring idled capacity back into operation. This is now happening (World Nuclear News). The uranium market has been facing a supply deficit for years due to underinvestment. The problem is that uranium mines take a long time and require a ton of capital to get up and running. A mine can take 10-15 years to begin production AFTER they are opened. As with other minerals, investment in geological exploration generally results in increased known resources. Over 2005 and 2006, exploration efforts resulted in the world’s known uranium resources increasing by 15% (World Nuclear Association). Therefore, there is no need to anticipate any uranium shortage.The world’s current measured resources of uranium will last about 90 years. This represents a higher level of assured resources than is normal for most minerals. There is nearly limitless supply because most of it has not been discovered due to little investment in mining and exploration. To be clear, although we know this uranium exists, that does not mean it has been mined.
