TSLA hits $1000. Makes it a first $1T Auto company,"So yes, this just happened, not sure what to say other than congrats on the gains to all the holders

This is incredible achievement and I am still not sure what is causing this. It took tech companies decades and many many successful products to reach this milestone while TSLA just breeze through it. Seems like market will never trade TSLA sideway so it can grow into the valuation but rather expanding it at this level. 

What are your thoughts on this feat.?

Was the TWTR bid by Elon just a way to hide a massive sale of TSLA Stock?,"Everywhere is reporting that Musk now has a ""massive windfall that dwarfs any bitcoin losses"" due to the sale of the TSLA stock to fund the TWTR deal, and as that deal is no longer going ahead, he's pockets the cash.

I'm then reminded that some shrewd analysts suggested that the divorces of Bezos and Gates to their wives were actually cover to sell massive amounts of stocks without causing a run on their companies (Founders selling huge chunks of stock usually causes investors to shit it but can be explained away for personal reasons).

I'm starting to think that Elon knows he's got a tough road ahead, the golden days of Tesla stock price are behind him and he's just liquidated massive amounts of stock at what will seem like a really high price in 10 years from now as all the big car manufacturers finally catch up and dilute Tesla's only real advantage (being first).

EDIT: wow, RIP my inbox and thanks for all the comments.

"Elon Musk says Tesla (TSLA) is worth $3,000 a share ‘if they execute really well’","Elon Musk told employees that he agrees with Ark Invest that Tesla (TSLA) is worth $3,000 a share “if they execute really well.” The CEO has often commented on Tesla’s stock price, but surprisingly, it was often to say that the price was too high. 

In 2020, when Tesla’s stock was reaching new high, Musk told his millions of followers on Twitters that he believed the stock was “too high”. It sent Tesla’s stock crashing, but now it is even higher than when Musk made the comment.

Tesla is currently trading at $733 a share and the automaker is the most valuable automotive company in the world at over $730 billion.

Wall Street firms are divided on whether or not the company is overvalued, but a few of them believe that Tesla could be worth a lot more. Ark Invest is one of them. Though to be fair, the company is also a large Tesla shareholders through its investment funds.

This week, they released a new note claiming a $3,000 base stock price target by 2025 for Tesla. Cathie Wood said about the price target during an interview with Yahoo Finance: “Our estimate for Tesla’s success has gone up. The main reason for that is their market share. Instead of going down from year-end 2017 to today, it has actually gone up fairly dramatically,” In its valuation models, Ark Invest believes that Tesla is going to deliver between 5 and 10 million vehicles as soon as 2025. That’s a significant ramp considering Tesla likely will deliver less than 1 million vehicles this year. The firm is also betting on Tesla delivering a completely autonomous ride-hailing network, known as Tesla Network, that is going to bring in a lot of money with high margin.

In an email to Tesla employee obtained by Electrek, Elon Musk shared with employees Ark’s new $3,000 price target and that he agrees with Ark: “If we execute really well, I agree with Ark Invest.” A $3,000 share price would put Tesla’s valuation at $3 trillion and make it the most valuable company in the world. 

Electrek’s Take

Since Ark’s new note was an update on their valuation model and price target, it is fair to say that Musk’s email is basically a direct comment on Tesla’s stock price. He believes that “if executed really well”, Tesla should be worth $3 trillion within the next 4 years.

Parted with TSLA this week after holding for 5 years. Here's why.,"Been a TSLA investor since 2017. This week I made the decision to pull out of the company (over 1,500 shares). After being up 800%+ at one point, I left after it came crashing back down to ~180%. I did not incur a loss, I am just not walking away with retirement levels of money that I could have possibly walked away with a mere year ago. Dumb? Maybe. Did I need to sell? No. Does it give me peace? Absolutely.

Being a TSLA investor was interesting. Elon has always been Elon and I believe the company is indeed positioned for long-term growth (even now). There were plenty of ups and downs, but I never 'doubted my vibe' and the Elon antics up until the latter half of 2022 I would have described almost as eccentric. The guy was an idiot from time to time, but was definitely doing something right. Tesla is competitive, innovative, and is a leader in the EV space. Long-term, the company has a ton of upward potential. Emphasis on the word 'potential.' 

However, there has been a change. Things with Elon have certainly become more radical and it seems that every single day there is a new headline that is slowly destroying the brand. Now, before we get into the whole ""but Elon isn't Tesla!"" let me tell you the incredible importance of consumer sentiment and branding. 

I do not imagine Tesla ever being divorced from Elon Musk. When you think ""Tesla"" you cannot escape thinking ""Elon Musk."" It is like trying to think about Microsoft without thinking or mentioning Bill Gates or some other strong brand-to-noun association. Go ahead and do yourself a favor and search Tesla now and see what comes up. Headline after headline is about Musk. This is not good for the brand, especially considering their consumer segment is actively being isolated. 

Now, one must ask: why do people buy things? There's a wide array of reasons, but I believe fundamentally it boils down to the value and reputation of the product. The value has a mix of factors that range from price, functionality, importance, etc. and reputation can be understood as how the brand is perceived, how the consumer is perceived as a result of owning the product, and how the consumer feels owning the product. This is where I lose the belief in the growth potential despite the positioning. Simply put, I do not think consumers are going to feel good about buying a Tesla with the negativity surrounding Elon. 

A mere year ago, if a person bought a Tesla or owned a Tesla, what would this say about a person? How would that person feel about that purchase? Tesla was the cool, sophisticated brand that was essentially symbolic of changing the world. Just look at Tesla's mission statement: ""Tesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy through increasingly affordable electric vehicles in addition to renewable energy generation and storage. Tesla is accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy."" 

Where is this brand now? How would a person feel now? Ask yourself, if someone pulled up in a Tesla what would you think about them? What feelings would it invoke?

Often times, we want to distance ourselves from feelings and sentiment and put an enormous emphasis on reason, facts, and data. This is not necessarily wrong, but this is certainly also not unique to the financial realm and TSLA has a history of this as well. We had people putting in orders for vehicles that were not being produced, people YOLOing their life savings into the stock because they believed in the future growth of the company before the company was seriously competitive, an unprecedented cult-like following that boosted the stock and gave the company an incredible amount of capital, and so on. Yet, when we look at TSLA now and think about the projected growth, why think people will actually want to continue to buy this product? Who is going to spend the money of a luxury vehicle to suddenly be associated with a person that people are increasingly viewing in a negative way? Not me. Apparently not my friends or co-workers either who were previously considering a Tesla and now want nothing to do with it. And apparently not my friend who is a Tesla owner and is starting to feel embarrassed for driving one. We can talk about how ""dumb"" these people are, but we cannot escape these are legitimate and valid sentiments toward the brand that have real costs associated with them.  

The sentiment cannot be captured in a graph right now. You have no data points on the would-be consumers because they are now never-were consumers. This data is only going to show in their sales. If sales continue to go up, then it seems reasonable to say that consumer sentiment has not reached a level where people feel so negatively about the product that they stopped buying. What I am suggesting here is that it my belief that this will inevitably happen because of the intimate link between Tesla and Elon. Tesla could get a new CEO, change leadership, etc., but I do not see them escaping this link and I believe it will ultimately be the detriment to the brand. Sales will not completely stop, but the growth projections that the stock relied heavily on I believe will certainly slow a lot sooner than shareholders anticipated and if it ever does reach previous target prices of $250+, this will not be for a long time. 

I'm not bullish or bearish on the stock. I do not think the company is going to suddenly vanish and the stock will drop to <$50 (at least I hope not for many of the investors I know). However, I also do not think the growth will be as aggressive as it once could have been and this is going to limit the stock in many ways. If we factor in slowed growth from the recession, one must keep in mind that this is just more time for Elon to further damage the brand between now and when people are in better buying conditions. What's next? Apparently removing Twitter's suicide prevention feature. Maybe tomorrow it's denying climate change and next month will be another stock sell off after yet another promise of not doing so. Though, ultimately, this is no longer my problem. The integrity of my financial future is no longer jeopardized by a guy that is becoming increasingly unhinged without the board properly exercising their duty to act in the interest of shareholders.

"Tesla (TSLA) PT Lowered to $115 at JPMorgan, 'We are slashing our estimates and price target'","
On Wednesday, JPMorgan revised its price target for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares, reducing it to $115 from the previous $130 while maintaining an Underweight rating. The adjustment follows Tesla's first-quarter delivery numbers, which significantly fell short of both JPMorgan's and consensus expectations.

Analysts at JPMorgan expressed concern that the disappointing delivery figures might impact investor confidence in Tesla's long-term growth prospects, which is vital for upholding the stock's high valuation multiple.

Tesla's vehicle sales for the first quarter of 2024 showed a year-over-year decline of 9%, contrasting with the Bloomberg consensus estimate which anticipated a growth of 6%, and the company-compiled consensus which expected a 5% increase. This miss represents the largest discrepancy from analyst estimates on record for the electric vehicle maker.

Previously, analysts projected that Tesla would sell 626,000 vehicles in the first quarter, marking a 48% year-over-year growth, but the actual sales reported were only 387,000 vehicles, which is 38% below the peak forecast from June 10, 2022.

In light of these results, JPMorgan has also reduced its estimates for Tesla's first-quarter revenue, now expecting $21.4 billion compared to the previous $25.6 billion, and below the consensus forecast of $23.5 billion. The firm's forecast for earnings per share (EPS) for the first quarter has been lowered to $0.42 from the prior estimate of $0.69, which is also beneath the consensus of $0.61.

The revised EPS forecast is a steep drop from the peak consensus of $1.94 before Tesla implemented a strategy of heavy discounting to boost unit volume in response to softening demand.

Moreover, JPMorgan now anticipates a significant free cash outflow of $1.3 billion for the first quarter, a reversal from its earlier expectation of a $300 million inflow, and contrary to the consensus for a $1 billion inflow. This expectation is based on the assumption of a record increase in finished goods inventory, as Tesla produced 47,000 more vehicles than it sold in the quarter.

This inventory buildup, according to JPMorgan, suggests that the lower deliveries were due to demand constraints rather than supply issues, refuting any implications that disruptions such as the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea or the fire incident at Tesla's Berlin Gigafactory were the primary causes.

JPMorgan warns that Tesla shares, which already saw a 4.9% decline on Tuesday compared to the S&P 500's 0.7% drop, could face further decreases if the company fails to quickly revive unit volume and revenue growth. The firm cautions that investors might reconsider the premium valuation multiple currently assigned to Tesla's stock in the absence of sustained growth.

Do you think TSLA might break below this year’s low at $620?,"Tesla is closing its office in San Mateo, California, and eliminating an estimated 200 jobs there, CNBC has confirmed, as part of a broader cost-cutting effort at the electric vehicle company.

We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"\*\* I have no position that is impacted by this post\*\*

Over the past few years, TSLA has performed nothing short of extraordinary. In the last five years, Tesla stock has almost 10x its value. The 857% total return of Tesla is substantially higher than all of its peers, including Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen

Despite strong growth, weakness has begun to present itself within the Wall Street prince in the past year. Tesla announced earlier in February 2023 that it would be cutting prices on the Model Y. This move surprised investors because, before the price cuts, Tesla appeared to be entirely supply-side constrained. However, investors noted that these cuts only impacted higher-end models that were outside the range of the mass vehicle market. However, in April, Tesla announced that it would be cutting prices on the Model 3. Elon Musk has previously alluded to a poor performing EV market in the wake of a higher interest rate environment. Economic data confirms this narrative as Automobile shipments have declined substantially in Q3’ 2023.

However, two factors that cannot be explained by an adverse economic environment are Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Cybertruck demand. FSD is Tesla’s end-to-end autonomous driving solution.

Tesla’s FSD is considered a level 2 autonomous driving solution. Level 2 systems require the driver to remain alert at all times with the anticipation that driver will have to take over in every circumstance. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly claimed that FSD would be finished by the end of the year for the past six years. Additionally, Musk has claimed that robo-taxis, completely automated taxi services would be available during the same timeframes. Tesla’s current FSD beta boasts some impressive technologies, including the ability to navigate through city streets without immediate intervention in many cases. However, level 3 seems to be uncertain  for the car company. On the other hand, Tesla’s competitors such as Waymo, Mobileye, and Cruise have all operated in some capacity at level 3 or level 4. In particular, Mobileye has proved to be a serious threat to FSD due to its goal of integrating in Tesla’s competitors. Mobileye has outlined several technologies that are set to compete with Tesla’s current offerings as well as Tesla’s future capabilities.

The Cybertruck further highlights Tesla’s habit of misleading shareholders. The Cybertruck is Tesla’s consumer pickup truck expected to be launched in Q4 2023. In Tesla’s Q2 2023 earnings call, Musk stated that Cybertruck demand is, ""so off the hook, you can’t even see the hook.” EV insider reported that this statement was likely to transfer into 1.9 million preorders. However, Tesla failed to mention that the Cybertruck’s preorder deposit was $100. In Tesla’s Q3 earnings call, Musk stated that “We dug our own grave” when referring to Cybertruck. He noted that he expects it to be 18 months before Cybertruck is cash flow positive, adding another timeline onto a timeline full of delays. Musk still sees demand surpassing one million units. However, it seems unlikely that demand will be that high, considering high interest rate environment and mere $100 commitment by prospective buyers.",stocks,TSLA,"We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA) \*\* I have no position that is impacted by this post\*\* Over the past few years, TSLA has performed nothing short of extraordinary.

Just sold half of my holdings in TSLA.,"      After months of weighing options I decided this was the best move for my family.

      I've been in TSLA since 2015 when I decided to invest as a single mother,  and never sold even when times were hard. TSLA ended up being a huge blessing for me and my son over the years!
 
        I made it through work being closed down for 9 months last year and half of this year, and never sold.     
       So, this step took alot for me, on a personal level.

      Because of my job being effected half of this year, my income was no where close to what it would have normally been...       I decided that selling half would give me some peace of mind with the economic climate where it is. I also knew that with my income being as low as it was this year, that this was possibly the last opportunity to avoid selling in a higher tax bracket.

        Of course, I had this mental struggle between selling and it then going higher.  But I've decided to just not let myself think on those terms.
     
 
       I now feel a security in knowing that if it rises, I still have half my holdings and will enjoy watching my position climb again.  And if it goes down, I will have the option to buy the dip.

       I was surprised at how stubborn my pride was when deciding whether to reduce position or not!   This ride has been wild over the years.

      I'm happy to still be on it! But happy I was able to exercise making a tough decision that I knew was the wisest, for me.

The future value of TSLA is not computable.,"You can't justify calculating TSLA's future value from the current numbers. You have to be expecting growth in sectors and markets not yet accessed by the company. That is eminently possible but with no information there is no reasonable way to estimate it. Your error bars are too large to create a valid result.

You also have to hope that the expected competition coming to the company's current sectors won't cause existing growth to slow. And that's not going to happen. Every car maker on Earth is coming for the EV market, because manufacturing most kinds of ICE cars is going to be banned in the future, and they want to remain in business, and will not find it hard to do so.

Bottom line: if Tesla doesn't start to access new business lines (robotics is a good example) it will start to get its ass kicked in EV, and it will collapse and be remembered as a fad.

That's all the certainty there is. It may go up, but it will certainly go down if it doesn't start reinventing. Getting any number of significant digits on its future value is magical thinking.",stocks,TSLA,"The future value of TSLA is not computable.

"TSLA plant in Monterrey, Mexico confirmed","Rumors have been circulating for at least a couple months, but confirmed now by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador: Tesla is set to build a brand new plant in Monterrey, Mexico. This is a huge boost for Mexico, as it's trying to establish itself as a hub for investment by bringing manufacturing capacity to North America and away from Asia, thanks to geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lopez Obrador revealed that he had a call with Elon Musk on Monday, and they came to an agreement that will create lots of jobs and bring in a considerable investment. The President had previously expressed concerns over water shortages, but Musk was receptive and has accepted Mexico's proposals.

This investment is a big test for Mexico's President, who has a reputation for being a bit of a resource nationalist. Some companies have been unsettled by his efforts to strengthen state control of the energy market at the expense of private capital. But with Mexico receiving its highest foreign direct investment inflows for years in 2022, it's clear that the country's lower-cost and skilled workforce is making it a global center for the car industry.

We don't know all the details just yet, but Lopez Obrador said Tesla will likely give us more information tomorrow. It's all happening during Musk's ""Investor Day,"" where he'll outline his ""Master Plan Part Three.""

"Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review 12/24/22","As always, below represents my opinions and should not be construed as financial advise. Always do you own due dilligence. I welcome your feedback of my opinions.

· **Company Description**

o ELI5 the company’s business model

§ Tesla primarily designs, develops and manufactures fully electronic vehicles and has a smaller solar generation and battery storage business. They are currently investing into self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots.

· **Company Soundness**

o How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

§ Tesla sells their products Direct to consumer. Their cars and solar options are purchased directly on their website. Most of the products they sell are durable goods. That is to say they are high ticket items that are often purchased once and without a frequent and recurring interval. Having said that, since Tesla is vertically integrated, they also have the potential to grow a larger service revenue stream for their products.

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

§ Very little. Tesla uses a meager $0.14 of debt for every $1 of equity on their balance sheet. This compares with 3.08 to 1 at Ford 1.76 to 1 at GM. Consequently, they have an extremely high 56x interest coverage ratio.

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

§ Yes, between the low debt and significant cash cushion they are well cushioned. This is evidenced by $19.5 billion in cash, $2.41 billion in unused credit lines. Additionally, Tesla is cash flow positive with the widest cash flow margins in the industry. Tesla expects Capex to be 6-8 billion over next two years. Management reported on their September 22 10-Q that they believe they have sufficient capital to fund their growth plans.

§ They do have $983 million of debt due in the next 12 months which is easily covered from their cash stash or through a refinance and extension of maturity.

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

§ None. Tesla is a new company and electric vehicles within transportation is a new industry. Having said that, history of the auto industry suggests high barriers. You have a business with large, fixed costs, a cyclical product and need some level of scale to allow customers to believe they can get it serviced.

§ Additionally, like capitalism often does, high returns attract new capital and bring about lower returns. The flight of capital has been seen; the question is will new players be able to make enduring franchises in a historically tough market?

o Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

§ Yes. Tesla now has enough scale to rival legacy auto manufacturers. They crush Ford and GM in virtually every financial metric. (TSLA, F, GM is the order of the following)

§ Gross Margin: 26.6%, 11.4%,13.6%

§ ROA: 17%, 3.5%, 3.8%

§ FCF margin: 11.9%, 1.7%, 0.8%

o What is the competitive advantage?

§ In my view, they have two advantages at this point: low-cost provider and Intangible assets

§ Low-Cost Provider:

· Relative to legacy players, Tesla has a lower cost operating model. For example, by selling 100% of their cars DTC they can sell them at retail prices to consumer whereas legacy auto sells their cars to dealers at wholesale prices. During a recessionary period, this will serve to benefit Tesla. As customers defer purchases of cars, prices will typically fold (this has started to occur with the most recent series of inflation reports) When you have 22% gross margins and 12% FCF margins, you can drop prices far lower and be profitable than when your competitors are at \~12% gross margins and \~1% free cash flow margins.

· It appears that this advantage is not done being flexed. Even with a lower overall volume of cars being sold combined with a significantly higher growth rate, Tesla’s revenue/employee continues to soar. Currently it is about the same as Ford and GM. I would expect in future years with additional growth, Tesla will surpass them.

§ Intangibles

· As a brand, Tesla is the undisputed leader in EVs. Having said that, Elon’s moves into twitter and more importantly politics of late have caused some people to put their nose up at Tesla. I personally feel this will be a passing thing, particularly as Elon has announced his intent to step down as CEO of twitter, although that does not mean he will stop tweeting. Despite this headwind, Elon and Tesla have been able to grow the brand through fanfare and organic attention rather than spending blocks of marketing dollars.

· Vertical integration. Tesla owns production and the service center network. This has allowed them to offer far better services. Currently, when your Tesla is in the shop, they attempt to give all customers fully loaded up-to-date versions of their current car to get them to salivate for an upgrade. They also make house calls and are sometimes able to repair your car in your driveway. Additionally, by vertically integrating the design and production process, they own the IP for the core components of the EVs. This gives them another cost advantage. They put the core components of their cars in at cost, other players put them in at a markup from their suppliers.

· First mover advantage. Tesla has outfitted with what they believe to be the necessary equipment for self-driving technology since October of 2016. This allowed them to have customers subsidize the cost by buying the car and gave them more data than any other company to develop this highly complicated technology. They also have a large charging network. Admittedly this benefit will likely lessen as the charging network infrastructure matures.

· Legacy costs. As in Tesla has none of them, whereas legacy auto has all the transition issues. Imagine trying to be Ford or GM and you know the future is EVs. What do you do with your unionize gas engineers? Will a layoff cause a strike? You know that selling through dealers puts you at a cost disadvantage, how do you cut them out of the deal? States have regulations that don’t allow dealers and manufactures to be owned by the same entity. How do you cut out dealers for sales but keep them for service? How do you solve the above issues while also maintaining profitability because you are heavily indebted in a fairly high interest rate environment? These aren’t so much strengths of Tesla, but are weaknesses of legacy auto.

· It is really hard to put into words all the changes Tesla has made. For example, they sell cars on their website without a model year advertised. This small but subtle change should help deal with the seasonality affect of ordering. Additionally, they have been able to add differentiated features to the car that nobody else has done before causing viral free advertising just for being cool. Ludicrous mode with the Spaceballs animation, verbal commands like “open your butthole” to access the charging port. It’s a joke, I get it, but it creates real buzz and interest.

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

§ No, you would likely need far more. As of now, $26 billion has been put into to Rivian and expects to produce 25,000 cars this year. As I mentioned earlier, the lack of new brands or the ability for players to scale up in the auto industry for such a long period of time is suggestive of the very real barriers. With higher rates and a recession looming, capital may be more difficult to come by for smaller less established players.

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

§ To be honest, much of the company could be replicated with capital. The big thing, is there are really no other major players who have been able to do it anywhere near as close to the scale with the financial success as Tesla.

o Are there competitive threats on the horizon?

§ Several. This is a big industry going through a significant change. When these things happen, that attracts a significant amount of capital and competition. Every major auto company is investing into EVs, new entrants are entering the space and even large competitors like Apple are looking to enter.

· **Growth**

o Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

§ Yes, Tesla is still a relatively small player in the auto space and has great trends with past growth and future expectations.

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

§ Yes, they have a long pipeline ahead of them and have investments that offer many call options on their business.

· **Watch List Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?

§ Kind of. Tesla is extremely complicated, operating in new industries with new technology. Its hard to say with confidence that I have a solid understanding of the factors given the increasing rate of change with energy production and auto.

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

§ Given the competitive strengths combined with the many weaknesses of the legacy operators I feel there is a real chance to cement an advantage in this rapidly evolving space.

§ It is also worth pointing out that long term, I feel the auto industry will go on to have similar economics of the aerospace industry. In the highly regulated aerospace industry, engines are often sold at breakeven or even a loss but come with highly lucrative 20-year service contracts making for high margin recurring revenue which gives these companies much of their value. While it is unlikely that auto will get as regulated as aerospace, I do think that the car itself over time will be more and more commoditized. The breadcrumbs for this are there. Tesla could have franchised service centers to grow with far less capex, but they didn’t. Tesla could have avoided the auto insurance like every other car company, but they are pursuing it. Obviously, the holy grail in the industry is self-driving. Conquering that gives an obvious service revenue stream for customers who purchase this add-on. Additionally, they can collect transportation fees on a robo-taxi network. Self-driving and the data from it obviously gives them a leg up on legacy insurance companies in evaluating the risk of their drivers.

§ When you put the clear cost advantage with the breadcrumbs to build the future, I think it is fair to say that Tesla earns a well deserved spot on a watch list.

· **Valuation**

o Value the company

§ Ha! Difficult, very difficult!

§ 2022 Rev Expectations: $83.075 billion

§ 2025 Rev Expectations: $167.5 Billion (26% CAGR)

§ 2028 rev Expectations: $315.7 Billion (23.5% CAGR from ’25 to ’28)

§ Shares outstanding as of 10/18/22 were 3,157,752,449

§ Over the past 6 months shares have increased at an annual rate of \~2.0%

§ Over the past 3 years they have increased at an annual rate of \~5.4%

§ Elon has discussed, but not started a buyback. Given their additional scale, and sufficient capital, I think it is prudent to project a lesser share count increase going forward. I will assume a 1% to 4% increase in shares.

§ This implies shares outstanding of 3.253 billion to 3.552 billion 3 years from now.

§ Since scale had been achieved, FCF margins have increased steadily to 11.9%. While a recession is likely to lower margins, long term additional service revenues and scale could easily raise them. I think a midpoint expectation of 14% with a range of 7% to 21% is probably fair.

§ To model a bear scenario I assumed a 25% reduction in revenue for the 2025 target to model effects from a recession and slower rollout of self-driving. For a bull case I assumed a 10% premium to the revenue target to assume better adoption. This gives us a revenue range $127.5 billion and $187.1 billion for ’25.

§ At a 7% FCF margin with 3.552 billion shares outstanding on revenue of $125.6 billion we get FCF per share of $2.46 in our bear case. With a 21% FCF margin on $184.2 billion of revenue with 3.253 billion shares we get a bullish FCF per share of 11.88.

§ With growth expectations in 2028 slowing but still high overall, I will assume a FCF yield between 2.5% to 5% for 2025.

§ When you put it all together you get an estimated value in 2025 of $98 to $237 per share for a mid-point of $168.05

§ With a current price of $123, this implies an annual return of 12% per year at the midpoint from these levels. The bull case implies a 25% CAGR and the bear case implies a loss of 6% per year.

o Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?

§ For me, I feel that given the uncertainty in the future of the industry and company overall I would want to earn a 15% per year on an investment on Tesla. Currently, my estimates suggest a 12% rate of return. To potentially earn 15%, Tesla would need to be purchased for a price less than $112. This leaves it marginally overvalued. It really boils down to what it always does, if you believe they will execute on the vision that has been laid out. If that is the case, gains will likely be quite nice from these levels.

Management reported on their September 22 10-Q that they believe they have sufficient capital to fund their growth plans. § They do have $983 million of debt due in the next 12 months which is easily covered from their cash stash or through a refinance and extension of maturity. · **Can it be Replicated?** o Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past? § None. Tesla is a new company and electric vehicles within transportation is a new industry. Having said that, history of the auto industry suggests high barriers. You have a business with large, fixed costs, a cyclical product and need some level of scale to allow customers to believe they can get it serviced. § Additionally, like capitalism often does, high returns attract new capital and bring about lower returns. The flight of capital has been seen; the question is will new players be able to make enduring franchises in a historically tough market? o Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials? § Yes. Tesla now has enough scale to rival legacy auto manufacturers. They crush Ford and GM in virtually every financial metric. (TSLA, F, GM is the order of the following) § Gross Margin: 26.6%, 11.4%,13.6% § ROA: 17%, 3.5%, 3.8% § FCF margin: 11.9%, 1.7%, 0.8% o What is the competitive advantage? § In my view, they have two advantages at this point: low-cost provider and Intangible assets § Low-Cost Provider: · Relative to legacy players, Tesla has a lower cost operating model. For example, by selling 100% of their cars DTC they can sell them at retail prices to consumer whereas legacy auto sells their cars to dealers at wholesale prices. During a recessionary period, this will serve to benefit Tesla. As customers defer purchases of cars, prices will typically fold (this has started to occur with the most recent series of inflation reports) When you have 22% gross margins and 12% FCF margins, you can drop prices far lower and be profitable than when your competitors are at \~12% gross margins and \~1% free cash flow margins. · It appears that this advantage is not done being flexed. Even with a lower overall volume of cars being sold combined with a significantly higher growth rate, Tesla’s revenue/employee continues to soar. Currently it is about the same as Ford and GM. I would expect in future years with additional growth, Tesla will surpass them. § Intangibles · As a brand, Tesla is the undisputed leader in EVs. Having said that, Elon’s moves into twitter and more importantly politics of late have caused some people to put their nose up at Tesla. I personally feel this will be a passing thing, particularly as Elon has announced his intent to step down as CEO of twitter, although that does not mean he will stop tweeting. Despite this headwind, Elon and Tesla have been able to grow the brand through fanfare and organic attention rather than spending blocks of marketing dollars. · Vertical integration. Tesla owns production and the service center network. This has allowed them to offer far better services. Currently, when your Tesla is in the shop, they attempt to give all customers fully loaded up-to-date versions of their current car to get them to salivate for an upgrade. They also make house calls and are sometimes able to repair your car in your driveway. Additionally, by vertically integrating the design and production process, they own the IP for the core components of the EVs. This gives them another cost advantage. They put the core components of their cars in at cost, other players put them in at a markup from their suppliers. · First mover advantage. Tesla has outfitted with what they believe to be the necessary equipment for self-driving technology since October of 2016. This allowed them to have customers subsidize the cost by buying the car and gave them more data than any other company to develop this highly complicated technology. They also have a large charging network. Admittedly this benefit will likely lessen as the charging network infrastructure matures. · Legacy costs. As in Tesla has none of them, whereas legacy auto has all the transition issues. Imagine trying to be Ford or GM and you know the future is EVs. What do you do with your unionize gas engineers? Will a layoff cause a strike? You know that selling through dealers puts you at a cost disadvantage, how do you cut them out of the deal? States have regulations that don’t allow dealers and manufactures to be owned by the same entity. How do you cut out dealers for sales but keep them for service? How do you solve the above issues while also maintaining profitability because you are heavily indebted in a fairly high interest rate environment? These aren’t so much strengths of Tesla, but are weaknesses of legacy auto. · It is really hard to put into words all the changes Tesla has made. For example, they sell cars on their website without a model year advertised. This small but subtle change should help deal with the seasonality affect of ordering. Additionally, they have been able to add differentiated features to the car that nobody else has done before causing viral free advertising just for being cool. Ludicrous mode with the Spaceballs animation, verbal commands like “open your butthole” to access the charging port. It’s a joke, I get it, but it creates real buzz and interest. o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company? § No, you would likely need far more. As of now, $26 billion has been put into to Rivian and expects to produce 25,000 cars this year. As I mentioned earlier, the lack of new brands or the ability for players to scale up in the auto industry for such a long period of time is suggestive of the very real barriers. With higher rates and a recession looming, capital may be more difficult to come by for smaller less established players. o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why? § To be honest, much of the company could be replicated with capital. The big thing, is there are really no other major players who have been able to do it anywhere near as close to the scale with the financial success as Tesla. o Are there competitive threats on the horizon? § Several. This is a big industry going through a significant change. When these things happen, that attracts a significant amount of capital and competition. Every major auto company is investing into EVs, new entrants are entering the space and even large competitors like Apple are looking to enter. · **Growth** o Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now? § Yes, Tesla is still a relatively small player in the auto space and has great trends with past growth and future expectations. o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period? § Yes, they have a long pipeline ahead of them and have investments that offer many call options on their business. · **Watch List Decision** o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision? § Kind of. Tesla is extremely complicated, operating in new industries with new technology. Its hard to say with confidence that I have a solid understanding of the factors given the increasing rate of change with energy production and auto. o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come? § Given the competitive strengths combined with the many weaknesses of the legacy operators I feel there is a real chance to cement an advantage in this rapidly evolving space. § It is also worth pointing out that long term, I feel the auto industry will go on to have similar economics of the aerospace industry. In the highly regulated aerospace industry, engines are often sold at breakeven or even a loss but come with highly lucrative 20-year service contracts making for high margin recurring revenue which gives these companies much of their value. While it is unlikely that auto will get as regulated as aerospace, I do think that the car itself over time will be more and more commoditized. The breadcrumbs for this are there. Tesla could have franchised service centers to grow with far less capex, but they didn’t. Tesla could have avoided the auto insurance like every other car company, but they are pursuing it. Obviously, the holy grail in the industry is self-driving. Conquering that gives an obvious service revenue stream for customers who purchase this add-on. Additionally, they can collect transportation fees on a robo-taxi network. Self-driving and the data from it obviously gives them a leg up on legacy insurance companies in evaluating the risk of their drivers. § When you put the clear cost advantage with the breadcrumbs to build the future, I think it is fair to say that Tesla earns a well deserved spot on a watch list. · **Valuation** o Value the company § Ha! Difficult, very difficult! § 2022 Rev Expectations: $83.075 billion § 2025 Rev Expectations: $167.5 Billion (26% CAGR) § 2028 rev Expectations: $315.7 Billion (23.5% CAGR from ’25 to ’28) § Shares outstanding as of 10/18/22 were 3,157,752,449 § Over the past 6 months shares have increased at an annual rate of \~2.0% § Over the past 3 years they have increased at an annual rate of \~5.4% § Elon has discussed, but not started a buyback. Given their additional scale, and sufficient capital, I think it is prudent to project a lesser share count increase going forward. I will assume a 1% to 4% increase in shares. § This implies shares outstanding of 3.253 billion to 3.552 billion 3 years from now. § Since scale had been achieved, FCF margins have increased steadily to 11.9%. While a recession is likely to lower margins, long term additional service revenues and scale could easily raise them. I think a midpoint expectation of 14% with a range of 7% to 21% is probably fair. § To model a bear scenario I assumed a 25% reduction in revenue for the 2025 target to model effects from a recession and slower rollout of self-driving. For a bull case I assumed a 10% premium to the revenue target to assume better adoption. This gives us a revenue range $127.5 billion and $187.1 billion for ’25. § At a 7% FCF margin with 3.552 billion shares outstanding on revenue of $125.6 billion we get FCF per share of $2.46 in our bear case. With a 21% FCF margin on $184.2 billion of revenue with 3.253 billion shares we get a bullish FCF per share of 11.88. § With growth expectations in 2028 slowing but still high overall, I will assume a FCF yield between 2.5% to 5% for 2025. § When you put it all together you get an estimated value in 2025 of $98 to $237 per share for a mid-point of $168.05 § With a current price of $123, this implies an annual return of 12% per year at the midpoint from these levels. The bull case implies a 25% CAGR and the bear case implies a loss of 6% per year. o Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels? § For me, I feel that given the uncertainty in the future of the industry and company overall I would want to earn a 15% per year on an investment on Tesla. Currently, my estimates suggest a 12% rate of return. To potentially earn 15%, Tesla would need to be purchased for a price less than $112. This leaves it marginally overvalued. It really boils down to what it always does, if you believe they will execute on the vision that has been laid out. If that is the case, gains will likely be quite nice from these levels.

Elon Musk believes Bill Gates had a big short position on Tesla (TSLA) and lost a lot of money,"Elon Musk revealed that he has heard that Bill Gates had a big short position on Tesla (TSLA), and he might have lost a lot of money on it.


 
Billionaires Musk and Gates don’t always have good words to say about each other, but they do appear to share similar concerns about climate change.

However, Gates made some strange comments about electrification last year, including that electric trucks, like the Tesla Semi, and electric airplanes will “probably never” work.

In a new interview on the Joe Rogan Experience, Musk was asked about those comments from gates.

Tesla’s CEO responded:

“He didn’t know what he was talking about. Probably somebody told him that and he is just not that close to the physics of it. I don’t think he is ill-intentioned here, I just think he doesn’t know what he is talking about.”

He added Tesla already has working prototypes of electric trucks that are transporting cargo – something that we already pointed out in our original report about Gates’ comment, including the fact that not only Tesla has working electric semi truck programs, but also other automakers like Daimler.

But then Musk revealed that he has heard that Gates was betting against Tesla with a large short position:

“I also heard that at one point he had a large short position. I don’t know if that’s true or not, but it seems weird. People I know who know the situation pretty well, I asked them “are you sure?” and they said “yes, he has a huge short position on Tesla”. That didn’t work out too well.”

We have reached out to Gates’ foundation to see if we could get a comment on Musk’s claim, and we will update if we get an answer.

Tesla has sometimes been the most shorted stock on the NASDAQ, and people who bet against the electric automaker lost $38 billion in 2020.

$TSLA Bullish price is 287USD (DD),"No emotions, minimum speculations, just raw impartial numbers. We will answer once and for all what is the fair value of TSLA.

&#x200B;

**Chapter 1. Bull thesis (and other lies I tell myself?)**

&#x200B;

Let's start with the typical bull thesis. The one you have probably encountered many times in the wilderness of reddit or twitter. It goes like this:

&#x200B;

* Tesla's car sales will grow 50% annually for foreseeable future. Eventually reaching annual production rate of 20M by 2030. Source: [Technoking himself](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310486616075579393)

&#x200B;

* Net margins will stay as high or even grow further from the latest 13.1% (Q4 2021). Commonly cited reasons are 4680, Gigacasting... maybe even Alien Dreadnought?

&#x200B;

* Tesla is a tech company. They will generate tons of revenue by selling software such as ~~Fraud~~ Full-Self-Driving, and might eventually launch their own marketplace (see AppStore).

&#x200B;

* Tesla is... *ETF**?* (cannot add a link to youtube video, but it is from solving the money problem)

&#x200B;

* Tesla ~~sex~~bot. Enough said.

&#x200B;

Let's start with an automotive sales part:

&#x200B;

* Say Tesla is such Gigachad^(TM) that it reaches 20M sales without reducing the prices or introducing the cheaper model(s). According to Q4 2021 Financial Report, current **ASP is $50.7K**, derived as auto revenue excl. regulatory credits divided by the number of delivered cars. Assuming 3% average inflation for the next 9 years (incl. current spike) the ASP in 2030 would be **$66.2K** (50.7 x 1.03\^9)

&#x200B;

* With **net margins of 13%** that would result in **66.2K x 20M x 0.13 = $172B net income**.

&#x200B;

* Eventually growth by 2030 will taper and converge to automotive industry average. As of writing, PEs of auto peers: Toyota - 9.64, Volkswagen - 6.88, Ford - 10.10, GM - 7.10, BMW - 4.75. But Tesla being Tesla, so we award an automotive **Tesla PE of 15**.

&#x200B;

* Tesla market cap by end 2030 is (drum roll...) **172B x 15 = 2.58T**. An absolute automotive leader with 20M sales at an average price of 66.2K USD, with outstanding operating margins (\~twice the industry average), with PE 15 (approximately twice the industry average) will triple from the current valuation (or double from January 3's)?

&#x200B;

* Taking an average of 7% market growth leads to Net Present Value (NPV) of 2.58T / 1.07\^9 = **1.4T\*,** so *...* Tesla on January 3rd was pretty fairly valued? Although why would anyone invest in a single stock for a 7% growth versus investing into SPY?

&#x200B;

* From the other angle, if you invest in TSLA now (market cap of 890B as of writing) it will return you (2.58 / 0.89)\^(1/9) = 1.125 or **12.5% annually**. Not too shabby, but also anything but impressive in contrast to its growth in the last two years.

&#x200B;

But careful observer would remind me that we are talking about *Tech* company and not an *Auto* company. But before we go there... let's discuss what is wrong with the bull thesis above.

&#x200B;

**Chapter 2. Automotive market.**

&#x200B;

Many analyses that I have read address future volumes only from the perspective of the supply. Analyses argue that the ramp up of the existing factories plus the introduction of new ones can support 50% growth, eventually reaching 20M car sales by 2030. What they often fail to address is the total addressable market (TAM), which is in our case the EV market in 2030. To be clear, below we will include both plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV) as parts of the EV market. The main reasoning is that for a wide target audience PHEV covers 95% of all use-cases (daily trips within a city) with electric power, therefore creates a real alternative to buying BEV (what happened to me and my wife personally). 

&#x200B;

No doubt the EV market will be enormous by 2030. In particular:

&#x200B;

* EU proposes to ban new ICE cars by 2035 ([source](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/eu-proposes-effective-ban-new-fossil-fuel-car-sales-2035-2021-07-14/)). Citation: ""... if the EU raised its CO2 emission reduction targets to 50% by 2030, it would bring new fossil-fuel car sales across the bloc down to virtually zero by then... Brussels also proposed allowing plug-in hybrids to count as low-emission vehicles up to 2030 ..."". From this we can assume **EV penetration rate of a 100% in EU by 2030.**

&#x200B;

* China plans to transition 40% vehicles sales to so-called ""New Energy vehicles"" (that include plug-in hybrids, fuel cells, and battery electric vehicles) by 2030 ([source](https://www.autonews.com/china/china-explores-ambitious-goal-ev-sales-2035)). So **EV penetration rate in China of 40% by 2030.**

&#x200B;

* and USA target half of all vehicles sold in 2030 in US to be electric (also includes plug-in hybrids, [source](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/climate/biden-tailpipe-emissions-electric-vehicles.html)), i.e. **50% EV penetration rate for the US by end 2030**

&#x200B;

* The rest of the World mostly do not have any plans for phasing-out Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) cars ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles)). Anecdotally, when I visited my hometown of 300K population (in former USSR country) last winter I couldn't locate a single EV, whereas they are common in European city where I live now. We will make an assumption of **20% EV penetration rate for the rest of the world.**

&#x200B;

2019 automotive sales by region as a percentage of the global are as follows ([source](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/passenger-car-sales-by-key-region-2010-2020e)): China - 26.5%, EU - 25.3%, US - 18.0%, Rest of the World - 30.2%. By taking into account assumptions on regional EV penetrations rate, we obtain: 0.265 x 0.4 + 0.253 x 1.0 + 0.180 x 0.5 + 0.302 x 0.2 = **0.509 or 50.9% global EV penetration rate.**

&#x200B;

The next step is to evaluate total car sales in 2030. There are various forecasts, however most of them are in the same ballpark. According to ResearchAndMarkets ([source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211014005505/en/Global-Automotive-Market-COVID-19-Growth-Forecast-2020-2030---ResearchAndMarkets.com)) global automotive sales should reach **122.8M units by 2030.** Worth noting that global automotive sales did not practically rise since 2016. Yet most of the research firms keep 2030 target by adjusting CAGR, which I personally find as an unlikely scenario. Especially with the recent inflation, chip shortage, supply chain and other issues.

&#x200B;

Nevertheless, by multiplying forecasted global automotive sales to global EV penetration rate we obtain **62.5M EV cars (PHEV + BEV) to be sold in 2030.** It is important to understand that this is a **bullish estimate rather than the base.** First of all, we applied a very rude global level calculation. To be more accurate we need to apply analysis on the regional levels. In particular, auto sales for the rest of the World and China are expected to grow much faster than in the EU region. Therefore, lower EV penetration rate of the former (20% and 40%) relative to the latter (100%) would result in the lower global EV sales by 2030 than we estimated. Second, it is clear by commentary of the experts and the press that the aforementioned phase-out plans are ambitious and can be taken as a stretch targets. Elon in 2020 himself believed that the global BEV market would only be 30M by 2030 ([source](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310486616075579393)).

&#x200B;

**Chapter 3. Tesla's market share.**

&#x200B;

From [EV-Volumes.com](https://EV-Volumes.com), we can take the annual global EV sales for the past years. It's easy to estimate Tesla's market share from this graph:

* 2018: 245K / 2082K = **11.8%**
* 2019: 367K / 2276K = **16.2%**
* 2020: 500K / 3240K = **15.4%**
* 2021: 936K / 6750K = **13.9%**

&#x200B;

Not to raise an alarm, but it looks like Tesla's market share peaked at 16.2% and already started to decay. Two years is a bit short of a timeframe to make conclusions on the trend. But it is difficult to restrain yourself from making a connection between the loss of Tesla's market share and ramp up of Chinese OEMs, VW (id family), and wide range of PHEV from legacy.

&#x200B;

For 2030, in my most bullish view Tesla can at most maintain its 13.9% market share. Take into account the combination of increasing aforementioned competition and almost nonexistent roadmap of Tesla. To elaborate, Tesla has in production four models (two original designs from aesthetics perspective - head and tail lamps, bumpers, interior, etc.) - Model S/X and Model 3/Y. Cybertruck is expected to launch soon, however according to Elon himself, the target for CT is a mere 250K annual production.

&#x200B;

Model S/X is already a 10-years old design (except for the front facelift and an interior update). Model 3/Y's original design is 5-years old with no major updates yet. Given the 4-5 year median time between announcements and production of Tesla, we should not expect any new mass production model(s) before 2026. Especially given an already long pipeline of unfinished projects (Cybertruck, Roadster - niche product, Semi, etc.). By that time Model 3/Y would be 9 year old design (comparable to the current state of Model S/X).

&#x200B;

We have observed firsthand what such aging without any major updates might mean for the sales. Since 2018 combined sales of Model S/X dropped from 101.5K to 24.4K in 2021 (it was going down consistently for all the previous years as well, so do not attribute overall drop just to a model refresh). It is not difficult to understand why. When someone buys a new car for $100K, that person wants to make sure that people around recognize it as a new car for $100K and not say 10-year old used one for the price of $30K.

&#x200B;

So in order for Tesla to keep up the market share it needs to step up its game in introducing new models and doing major updates for existing ones. If people will start considering Model 3/Y to be rather outdated, the demand will fall off the cliff as we have seen with Model S/X. The fall of Model S/X can be attributed to the release of Model 3/Y. But unlike in 2017, there are far more alternatives now to the aging Model 3/Y as well.

&#x200B;

Despite all that, let's consider Tesla will sustain its 13.9% market share through 2030. Recall our estimates on EV global sales of 62.5M in 2030 and we obtain **8.7M Tesla cars to be sold in 2030.** This is whopping **56.5% lower** than in the original bull thesis, and will respectively lead to a **TSLA valuation of 1.12T USD in 2030.** An **annual return of 2.5% (below inflation)** if you invest at current prices.

&#x200B;

**Chapter 4. ASP**

&#x200B;

Perhaps for Teslanaires throwing $50K at a car is no big deal, but for most people said $50K is actually big money. If Tesla wants to sell 8.7M cars it needs to either (or preferably both) reduce the ASP of existing model lines or introduce cheaper ones. Especially given the aforementioned points on increasing competition, poor roadmap and aging line-up.

&#x200B;

8.7M correspond to 7.1% of the total projected car sales in 2030. Only two brands (note, not manufacturers) had comparable market shares in 2020, namely Toyota with 8.5% and Volkswagen with 7.8% respectively ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/316786/global-market-share-of-the-leading-automakers/)). It is only logical to assume that the price distribution of Tesla cars should follow that of a Toyota or Volkswagen rather than, for example, Mercedez-Benz (3.1%) or BMW (2.7%). Neither Toyota Motor Corporation nor Volkswagen Group do not break down the sales and revenues by brands. We will take Toyota as an example as it only contains 2 major brands (Toyota and Lexus) in contrast to 5 major brands of Volkswagen (Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda, Seat and Porsche).

&#x200B;

According to the latest [Toyota Financial report](https://global.toyota/pages/global_toyota/ir/financial-results/2022_3q_presentation_en.pdf) (Q1-Q3 combined) **ASP of Toyota car is 3.8M yen or 33K USD**, estimated by dividing automotive revenue of 23.3T yen by car deliveries of 6.1M. In reality these 23.3T yen also included financial services, and 6.1M deliveries also include Lexus, but it's a good enough approximation. Under the assumption that Tesla can dictate $5K premium for the same market share, **Tesla's 2030 ASP is $49.5K** (38K x 1.03\^9) or **25% lower** than the original bull thesis assumption of $66K.

&#x200B;

Deducting these extra 25% results in **TSLA valuation by end 2030 of $840B**, or **-0.7%** **annual return if you invest today**. See the discrepancy between these numbers and 3-10T valuations TSLAnalysts target for as soon as 2025? And they often claim that nothing other than auto sales are included in their models.

&#x200B;

**Margins.**

&#x200B;

One topic I will not touch in this post is net margins, as it deserves its own DD. For now we assumed the same margins in all of the cases. In fact, lower ASP (e.g. cheaper models), increasing number of service centers (to keep up with production), etc. would definitely put a pressure on margins. On the other hand Tesla investments in Gigacasting and structural batteries might (or might not) help to increase margins. Drawbacks of the latter two is lower (to none) repairability that would lead to higher warranties costs. As I said, the topic deserves its own DD.

&#x200B;

**Chapter 5. Share dilution or Twitter polls**

&#x200B;

When we discuss the share price we should also touch such concept as *share dilution.* Even if Elon personally says enough and stops diluting shareholders via his out-of-this-universe bonus plans. Note that for the last 5 years alone number of outstanding shares increased from 0.8B to 1.12B ([source](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/shares-outstanding)), and to my understanding that might not yet include non-executed options of Elon (experts please weigh in).

&#x200B;

Due to the expected high-growth, i.e. ramp ups of existing ~~factories~~ Gigafactories and introduction of new models, Tesla is unlikely to offer stock buybacks until 2030. And even if we assume that Tesla will not raise any more funds either, share dilution will still take place via employee stock compensations alone.

&#x200B;

A good comparison would be Amazon, unlike Microsoft or Apple who offer a lot of buybacks. For the last 7 years Amazon experienced an average share dilution of 1.1% ([source](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/shares-outstanding)). Needless to say this is a bullish target for a company in a more infancy stage such as Tesla. Applying average of 1.1% over the course of 9 years (end of 2030) brings **total share dilution to 10.3%** (1.011\^9).

&#x200B;

On top of that, Elon demonstrated that not only he loves to bonus compensations, he is open to sell them, i.e. increase the *float.* Which is in short to mid term is even more important for a stock price than outstanding shares as it increases the supply on the open market. But in shouldn't play a role in theory for the long term (again, in theory).

&#x200B;

**The results:**

&#x200B;

If I would want to invest in Tesla now, such that it returns me in average annually 10% (vs 7% average of SPY) and we apply:

* our estimated target for market cap of **840B USD**, 
* and take into account bullish 10.3% share dilution, 

Tesla should not be valued more than: 840 / 1.1\^9 / (1.103) **= 323B USD today**

&#x200B;

Or with the current number of outstanding shares: 323B / 1.123B = **287 USD per share today**

&#x200B;

For Tesla bulls: before you say it's outrageous, note how this model still results in $TSLA current market cap equivalent of Toyota and way bigger than VW group. And all that due to the high expectations of growth alone. However, **expectations of high growth over the long timeframe involves a lot of risks, that we didn't even account for.**

&#x200B;

**Chapter other product lines of Tesla:**

&#x200B;

As for the other product lines, it's difficult to judge them now as they are in their infancy. Solar installation seems to be dropping since the days of SolarCity ([source](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2018/05/03/tesla-energy-storage-deployments-way-up-solar-slows-further/)). Since 2018 solar installations seems to be recovering and the energy storage seems to be increasing (source: latest quarterly report). However, it is clear from the financial statements that both of these businesses lose money already on the gross margin level. In particular, Tesla reported Automotive Gross margins of 29.3% and *Total* Gross margins of 25.3%.

&#x200B;

How a company exactly calculates gross expenses might differ, but losing money on the gross margin is rarely a good sign. It often means that the costs of goods sold already exceeds the selling price. Think of it as Tesla spending $100 to buy solar tiles, another $50 for shipping, and $200 for labor to install it, whereas only sells it for $250 to a customer. On top of that there are operational expenses that include general management and accounting, engineers, marketing, their bonuses, office expenses, etc. that affect Operating margins.

&#x200B;

The TAM of storage and solar by 2030 is debatable. It is clear however, that the biggest solar companies in the world ([source](https://www.investopedia.com/10-biggest-solar-companies-5077655)) have valuations of just few billions. So adding 100s of billions to Tesla's valuation based on Solar business is unreasonable. I bet the same holds for energy installation business.

&#x200B;

**Chapter Hype: Fraud Self Driving**

&#x200B;

This one is the closest to my heart. Disclaimer, I work for the top automotive semiconductor company and contribute to automotive sensors for high-level autonomy. And by proxy, I also have some understanding of the post-processing side of things, what Silicon Valley folks refer to as Machine Learning, Sensor Fusion, Behavioral Planning, etc. So I could probably write the whole DD just related to this topic, but instead I will try to keep this chapter simple. No discussions on the strategy, sensor suits, architectures. We will only talk about simple concept - *disengagements.*

&#x200B;

Since Tesla doesn't share any statistics on disengagements of FSD, we can only rely on the videos coming from the OG Tesla ~~shills~~ beta-testers. If you explore the prairies of Youtube you will encounter hundreds, if not thousands, of FSD videos. At first, you would be even impressed. But we fellow investors should not mix emotions with raw numbers.

&#x200B;

After your careful research you would realize that (anecdotally) average disengagement rate is about 1 disengagement per 1-5 miles. Elon's statements on Tesla being on the path of marching nines is heavily misleading. If you think emotionally, a car driving all by itself for 1 to 5 mile is an impressive feat. And maybe it is, which is not an achievement of Tesla per se, but the whole industry since the days of Darpa's challenges and even before.

&#x200B;

But if we think practically, we realize that 1-5 miles is too short of a distance. In average US driver drove 14000miles in 2019 ([source](https://www.kbb.com/car-advice/average-miles-driven-per-year/)). For the sake of the argument, let's say that not all FSD disengagements would have led to lethal accidents if not taken. Be it 10%... f\*\*k it, say 1%. That is still 1 lethal accident per 100-500 miles. Or 28 - 140 lethal accidents per year. Would you trust a system to drive you or your loved one home, if you know that the system will try to (or successfully) kill you every second week or even day.

&#x200B;

If Tesla reduces disengagement rate from there by 100, You still end up with 0.28 - 1.4 dangerous disengagement per year. That's where the big problem starts to appear. Since a car is NOT trying to kill you for 364 days in a year, you start to become complacent and that's where the first accidents will happen. After few lethal accidents people perhaps will become very cautious again.

&#x200B;

Fast forward, Tesla reduces disengagement rate by another factor of 100. Now it's one lethal accident in 100-300 years! Tesla so far produced 2.5M cars with FSD take rate of 10%, i.e. 250K wild FSDs out there. And that results *still* in 830 to 2500 lethal accidents per year due to FSD.

&#x200B;

And that is how marching nines looks like. When Tesla will fight against statistics as people will get more and more complacent. But we are long way from this.

&#x200B;

**Chapter Hype: To be continued...**

&#x200B;

I could also rant about 4680, Gigacasting, vertical integration. Especially on the last topic I have something to say from semiconductor perspectives (given Tesla's ambitions with FSD chip and DoJo). But all of these topics I might include in some other DD later on.

&#x200B;

**Chapter History.**

&#x200B;

A bit of a detour into a history of stock market. I like to compare Tesla to C*isco*. Just like Tesla, Cisco was **the** ***stonk*** **in 2000**. Cisco actually was the **World's biggest** company by market cap with a valuation of 500B, adjusted to inflation - 800B. But that number makes no justice to what Cisco was. In 2000 the World GDP was about 34B vs 84B now (source: [statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268750/global-gross-domestic-product-gdp/)), SPY was around 150 vs 470 now. So, Cisco price was equivalent to 1.25 to 1.5T of today's dollars.

&#x200B;

And yet, market analysts did claim that Cisco still had a lot of room to grow. For instance, [this bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1999-09-13/cisco-could-be-the-safest-net-play-around) claims Cisco was the safest Net play back then. And another [nice fella from Credit Suisse believed](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2000/03/20/story2.html) Cisco will be valued at 1T in just a few years! 1T of 2000 dollars no less. Does such claims sound familiar? At the time of the article, 37 investment banks rated it buy or strong buy, and NONE sell or even hold! By the way, article was released on 19 March 2000. See how they almost perfectly timed the top?

&#x200B;

By looking at CSCO all-time chart you can see how the story ended. In 20 years the price haven't recovered to it's ATH. Add to that how much market has grown, inflation, and you will realize that the real returns are much worse than -28%. Nowadays Cisco is the real solid company with a current valuation of 230B and PE ratio of 20. The problem is it was just too overvalued and too overhyped around 2000. Was Cisco a part of the future back in 2000? Absolutely. But sometimes you need to ask yourself how much that future is worth.

&#x200B;

It doesn't really matter whether Tesla is 1-5-10 years ahead of competition. What matters is how much that lead actually worth?

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

&#x200B;

My conclusion results that the bullish target for TSLA is 287USD. I am not a financial advisor so only you yourself are responsible for you financial decisions.

&#x200B;

P.S. Fun fact, $TSLA is valued at approx. $890B / 2.5M = $356K per every car Tesla ever sold (it was $480K per car as late as January 3). When Hertz ""announced"" 100K order from Tesla, $TSLA jumped around $400K per every car. This creates an interesting philosophical question: didn't we just discover perpetuum mobile? You can buy a Tesla car from a wealth generated by $TSLA which in fact would increase the value of former even more. Could it be that all Tesla buyers are former or current $TSLA holders? khm....

Edit: since many people are so kind to ask me to short Tesla, I just wanted to make clear I already shorted: [positions](https://imgur.com/a/EOz1rlC). Main position is 25x 250p Jan'23.",stocks,TSLA,"$TSLA Bullish price is 287USD (DD) No emotions, minimum speculations, just raw impartial numbers. We will answer once and for all what is the fair value of TSLA. &; **Chapter 1. Bull thesis (and other lies I tell myself?)** &; Let's start with the typical bull thesis. The one you have probably encountered many times in the wilderness of reddit or twitter. It goes like this: &; * Tesla's car sales will grow 50% annually for foreseeable future. Eventually reaching annual production rate of 20M by 2030. Source: [Technoking himself]( &; * Net margins will stay as high or even grow further from the latest 13.1% (Q4 2021). Commonly cited reasons are 4680, Gigacasting... maybe even Alien Dreadnought? &; * Tesla is a tech company. They will generate tons of revenue by selling software such as ~~Fraud~~ Full-Self-Driving, and might eventually launch their own marketplace (see AppStore). &; * Tesla is... *ETF**?* (cannot add a link to youtube video, but it is from solving the money problem) &; * Tesla ~~sex~~bot. Enough said. &; Let's start with an automotive sales part: &; * Say Tesla is such Gigachad^(TM) that it reaches 20M sales without reducing the prices or introducing the cheaper model(s). According to Q4 2021 Financial Report, current **ASP is $50.7K**, derived as auto revenue excl. regulatory credits divided by the number of delivered cars. Assuming 3% average inflation for the next 9 years (incl. current spike) the ASP in 2030 would be **$66.2K** (50.7 x 1.03\^9) &; * With **net margins of 13%** that would result in **66.2K x 20M x 0.13 = $172B net income**. &; * Eventually growth by 2030 will taper and converge to automotive industry average. As of writing, PEs of auto peers: Toyota - 9.64, Volkswagen - 6.88, Ford - 10.10, GM - 7.10, BMW - 4.75. But Tesla being Tesla, so we award an automotive **Tesla PE of 15**. &; * Tesla market cap by end 2030 is (drum roll...) **172B x 15 = 2.58T**. An absolute automotive leader with 20M sales at an average price of 66.2K USD, with outstanding operating margins (\~twice the industry average), with PE 15 (approximately twice the industry average) will triple from the current valuation (or double from January 3's)? &; * Taking an average of 7% market growth leads to Net Present Value (NPV) of 2.58T / 1.07\^9 = **1.4T\*,** so *...* Tesla on January 3rd was pretty fairly valued? Although why would anyone invest in a single stock for a 7% growth versus investing into SPY? &; * From the other angle, if you invest in TSLA now (market cap of 890B as of writing) it will return you (2.58 / 0.89)\^(1/9) = 1.125 or **12.5% annually**. Not too shabby, but also anything but impressive in contrast to its growth in the last two years. &; But careful observer would remind me that we are talking about *Tech* company and not an *Auto* company. But before we go there... let's discuss what is wrong with the bull thesis above. &; **Chapter 2. Automotive market.** &; Many analyses that I have read address future volumes only from the perspective of the supply. Analyses argue that the ramp up of the existing factories plus the introduction of new ones can support 50% growth, eventually reaching 20M car sales by 2030. What they often fail to address is the total addressable market (TAM), which is in our case the EV market in 2030. To be clear, below we will include both plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV) as parts of the EV market. The main reasoning is that for a wide target audience PHEV covers 95% of all use-cases (daily trips within a city) with electric power, therefore creates a real alternative to buying BEV (what happened to me and my wife personally). &; No doubt the EV market will be enormous by 2030. In particular: &; * EU proposes to ban new ICE cars by 2035 ([source]( Citation: ""... if the EU raised its CO2 emission reduction targets to 50% by 2030, it would bring new fossil-fuel car sales across the bloc down to virtually zero by then... Brussels also proposed allowing plug-in hybrids to count as low-emission vehicles up to 2030 ..."". From this we can assume **EV penetration rate of a 100% in EU by 2030.** &; * China plans to transition 40% vehicles sales to so-called ""New Energy vehicles"" (that include plug-in hybrids, fuel cells, and battery electric vehicles) by 2030 ([source]( So **EV penetration rate in China of 40% by 2030.** &; * and USA target half of all vehicles sold in 2030 in US to be electric (also includes plug-in hybrids, [source]( i.e. **50% EV penetration rate for the US by end 2030** &; * The rest of the World mostly do not have any plans for phasing-out Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) cars ([source]( Anecdotally, when I visited my hometown of 300K population (in former USSR country) last winter I couldn't locate a single EV, whereas they are common in European city where I live now. We will make an assumption of **20% EV penetration rate for the rest of the world.** &; 2019 automotive sales by region as a percentage of the global are as follows ([source]( China - 26.5%, EU - 25.3%, US - 18.0%, Rest of the World - 30.2%. By taking into account assumptions on regional EV penetrations rate, we obtain: 0.265 x 0.4 + 0.253 x 1.0 + 0.180 x 0.5 + 0.302 x 0.2 = **0.509 or 50.9% global EV penetration rate.** &; The next step is to evaluate total car sales in 2030. There are various forecasts, however most of them are in the same ballpark. According to ResearchAndMarkets ([source]( global automotive sales should reach **122.8M units by 2030.** Worth noting that global automotive sales did not practically rise since 2016. Yet most of the research firms keep 2030 target by adjusting CAGR, which I personally find as an unlikely scenario. Especially with the recent inflation, chip shortage, supply chain and other issues. &; Nevertheless, by multiplying forecasted global automotive sales to global EV penetration rate we obtain **62.5M EV cars (PHEV + BEV) to be sold in 2030.** It is important to understand that this is a **bullish estimate rather than the base.** First of all, we applied a very rude global level calculation. To be more accurate we need to apply analysis on the regional levels. In particular, auto sales for the rest of the World and China are expected to grow much faster than in the EU region. Therefore, lower EV penetration rate of the former (20% and 40%) relative to the latter (100%) would result in the lower global EV sales by 2030 than we estimated. Second, it is clear by commentary of the experts and the press that the aforementioned phase-out plans are ambitious and can be taken as a stretch targets. Elon in 2020 himself believed that the global BEV market would only be 30M by 2030 ([source]( &; **Chapter 3. Tesla's market share.** &; From [EV-Volumes.com]( we can take the annual global EV sales for the past years. It's easy to estimate Tesla's market share from this graph: * 2018: 245K / 2082K = **11.8%** * 2019: 367K / 2276K = **16.2%** * 2020: 500K / 3240K = **15.4%** * 2021: 936K / 6750K = **13.9%** &; Not to raise an alarm, but it looks like Tesla's market share peaked at 16.2% and already started to decay. Two years is a bit short of a timeframe to make conclusions on the trend. But it is difficult to restrain yourself from making a connection between the loss of Tesla's market share and ramp up of Chinese OEMs, VW (id family), and wide range of PHEV from legacy. &; For 2030, in my most bullish view Tesla can at most maintain its 13.9% market share. Take into account the combination of increasing aforementioned competition and almost nonexistent roadmap of Tesla. To elaborate, Tesla has in production four models (two original designs from aesthetics perspective - head and tail lamps, bumpers, interior, etc.) - Model S/X and Model 3/Y. Cybertruck is expected to launch soon, however according to Elon himself, the target for CT is a mere 250K annual production. &; Model S/X is already a 10-years old design (except for the front facelift and an interior update). Model 3/Y's original design is 5-years old with no major updates yet. Given the 4-5 year median time between announcements and production of Tesla, we should not expect any new mass production model(s) before 2026. Especially given an already long pipeline of unfinished projects (Cybertruck, Roadster - niche product, Semi, etc.). By that time Model 3/Y would be 9 year old design (comparable to the current state of Model S/X). &; We have observed firsthand what such aging without any major updates might mean for the sales. Since 2018 combined sales of Model S/X dropped from 101.5K to 24.4K in 2021 (it was going down consistently for all the previous years as well, so do not attribute overall drop just to a model refresh). It is not difficult to understand why. When someone buys a new car for $100K, that person wants to make sure that people around recognize it as a new car for $100K and not say 10-year old used one for the price of $30K. &; So in order for Tesla to keep up the market share it needs to step up its game in introducing new models and doing major updates for existing ones. If people will start considering Model 3/Y to be rather outdated, the demand will fall off the cliff as we have seen with Model S/X. The fall of Model S/X can be attributed to the release of Model 3/Y. But unlike in 2017, there are far more alternatives now to the aging Model 3/Y as well. &; Despite all that, let's consider Tesla will sustain its 13.9% market share through 2030. Recall our estimates on EV global sales of 62.5M in 2030 and we obtain **8.7M Tesla cars to be sold in 2030.** This is whopping **56.5% lower** than in the original bull thesis, and will respectively lead to a **TSLA valuation of 1.12T USD in 2030.** An **annual return of 2.5% (below inflation)** if you invest at current prices. &; **Chapter 4. ASP** &; Perhaps for Teslanaires throwing $50K at a car is no big deal, but for most people said $50K is actually big money. If Tesla wants to sell 8.7M cars it needs to either (or preferably both) reduce the ASP of existing model lines or introduce cheaper ones. Especially given the aforementioned points on increasing competition, poor roadmap and aging line-up. &; 8.7M correspond to 7.1% of the total projected car sales in 2030. Only two brands (note, not manufacturers) had comparable market shares in 2020, namely Toyota with 8.5% and Volkswagen with 7.8% respectively ([source]( It is only logical to assume that the price distribution of Tesla cars should follow that of a Toyota or Volkswagen rather than, for example, Mercedez-Benz (3.1%) or BMW (2.7%). Neither Toyota Motor Corporation nor Volkswagen Group do not break down the sales and revenues by brands. We will take Toyota as an example as it only contains 2 major brands (Toyota and Lexus) in contrast to 5 major brands of Volkswagen (Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda, Seat and Porsche). &; According to the latest [Toyota Financial report]( (Q1-Q3 combined) **ASP of Toyota car is 3.8M yen or 33K USD**, estimated by dividing automotive revenue of 23.3T yen by car deliveries of 6.1M. In reality these 23.3T yen also included financial services, and 6.1M deliveries also include Lexus, but it's a good enough approximation. Under the assumption that Tesla can dictate $5K premium for the same market share, **Tesla's 2030 ASP is $49.5K** (38K x 1.03\^9) or **25% lower** than the original bull thesis assumption of $66K. &; Deducting these extra 25% results in **TSLA valuation by end 2030 of $840B**, or **-0.7%** **annual return if you invest today**. See the discrepancy between these numbers and 3-10T valuations TSLAnalysts target for as soon as 2025? And they often claim that nothing other than auto sales are included in their models. &; **Margins.** &; One topic I will not touch in this post is net margins, as it deserves its own DD. For now we assumed the same margins in all of the cases. In fact, lower ASP (e.g. cheaper models), increasing number of service centers (to keep up with production), etc. would definitely put a pressure on margins. On the other hand Tesla investments in Gigacasting and structural batteries might (or might not) help to increase margins. Drawbacks of the latter two is lower (to none) repairability that would lead to higher warranties costs. As I said, the topic deserves its own DD. &; **Chapter 5. Share dilution or Twitter polls** &; When we discuss the share price we should also touch such concept as *share dilution.* Even if Elon personally says enough and stops diluting shareholders via his out-of-this-universe bonus plans.

Tesla so far produced 2.5M cars with FSD take rate of 10%, i.e. 250K wild FSDs out there. And that results *still* in 830 to 2500 lethal accidents per year due to FSD. &; And that is how marching nines looks like. When Tesla will fight against statistics as people will get more and more complacent. But we are long way from this. &; **Chapter Hype: To be continued...** &; I could also rant about 4680, Gigacasting, vertical integration. Especially on the last topic I have something to say from semiconductor perspectives (given Tesla's ambitions with FSD chip and DoJo). But all of these topics I might include in some other DD later on. &; **Chapter History.** &; A bit of a detour into a history of stock market. I like to compare Tesla to C*isco*. Just like Tesla, Cisco was **the** ***stonk*** **in 2000**. Cisco actually was the **World's biggest** company by market cap with a valuation of 500B, adjusted to inflation - 800B. But that number makes no justice to what Cisco was. In 2000 the World GDP was about 34B vs 84B now (source: [statista]( SPY was around 150 vs 470 now. So, Cisco price was equivalent to 1.25 to 1.5T of today's dollars. &; And yet, market analysts did claim that Cisco still had a lot of room to grow. For instance, [this bloomberg article]( claims Cisco was the safest Net play back then. And another [nice fella from Credit Suisse believed]( Cisco will be valued at 1T in just a few years! 1T of 2000 dollars no less. Does such claims sound familiar? At the time of the article, 37 investment banks rated it buy or strong buy, and NONE sell or even hold! By the way, article was released on 19 March 2000. See how they almost perfectly timed the top? &; By looking at CSCO all-time chart you can see how the story ended. In 20 years the price haven't recovered to it's ATH. Add to that how much market has grown, inflation, and you will realize that the real returns are much worse than -28%. Nowadays Cisco is the real solid company with a current valuation of 230B and PE ratio of 20. The problem is it was just too overvalued and too overhyped around 2000. Was Cisco a part of the future back in 2000? Absolutely. But sometimes you need to ask yourself how much that future is worth. &; It doesn't really matter whether Tesla is 1-5-10 years ahead of competition. What matters is how much that lead actually worth? &; **Conclusion** &; My conclusion results that the bullish target for TSLA is 287USD. I am not a financial advisor so only you yourself are responsible for you financial decisions. &; P.S. Fun fact, $TSLA is valued at approx. $890B / 2.5M = $356K per every car Tesla ever sold (it was $480K per car as late as January 3). When Hertz ""announced"" 100K order from Tesla, $TSLA jumped around $400K per every car. This creates an interesting philosophical question: didn't we just discover perpetuum mobile? You can buy a Tesla car from a wealth generated by $TSLA which in fact would increase the value of former even more. Could it be that all Tesla buyers are former or current $TSLA holders? khm.... Edit: since many people are so kind to ask me to short Tesla, I just wanted to make clear I already shorted: [positions]( Main position is 25x 250p Jan'23.",0.07277758435594257,1

What would need to happen for TSLA to *not* be overvalued today?,"Currently TSLA is trading close to $265/share, or about an $880B market cap.

It's a reasonable argument that if an asset can beat the S&P 500 CAGR, then it's a good investment. Given that the S&P typically provides a 5% CAGR, let's see what would be needed for Tesla to achieve a 10% CAGR by, let's say.. end of 2030.

$880B \* 1.10\^7 = $1.71T market cap, or about $512/share

So how does Tesla make it to a $1.7T market cap in 2030? I'm going to assume a 30 P/E, which everyone will bitch and complain about beause they hate Tesla, but I think there's reasonable arguments for and against 30. The ""for"" argument being that I believe they'll still be growing EV sales and energy storage products. If a 30 P/E, then Tesla needs:

$1710B / 30 = $57B in gaap earnings

So how much gaap earnings does Tesla make per EV sold? I'll link to a graph of the ""TTM avg gaap earnings per EV sold"" in the comments

Tesla's current earnings profitability is about $5,600 per EV sold, and it continues to go up over the long term, even if rates have caused a recent drop (earnings per EV maxed out at $10.3k in q1 2022). Let's just assume a long term profitability of $5,700 per EV (super conservative imo). Tesla will need to sell about

$57B earnings / $5,700 earnings per EV = 10M EVs annually

Conclusion: If Tesla sells 10M EVs in 2030, then it is not overvalued today, in fact.. it beats the S&P.

Everything below this line was written before the release of P&D numbers \~

&#x200B;

TSLA is going to release its 2024Q2 P&D numbers in the next couple of hours, WS analysts think that total delivery could reach 438,019 (vs 466,140, i.e. around 6% YoY drop).

In my opinion, 438K is still far too high based on continuous checking shared by a lot of non-WS analysts - which is supported by the data regularly released in Mainland China, Europe and the United States. The educated estimates should be ranging from 415K to 420K, implying at least 9% YoY decline.

Recall in January 2024's investor call that Mr. CEO was saying TSLA is between two major growth waves while no further guidance was provided (very tricky to be honest), does it mean ""low growth"" or actually ""no growth""?

Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress","Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event — where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm’s Cybercab self-driving concept car — failed to impress investors.

Tesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.

Musk revealed Tesla’s Cybercab concept vehicle — a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals — on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.

The Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.

He also said he expects Tesla to have “unsupervised FSD” up and running in Texas and California next year in the company’s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla’s premium driver assistance system, available today in a “supervised” version for Tesla electric vehicles.

The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

In reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous driving future.

“As expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla’s growth endeavors in AI/AV \[autonomous vehicles\],” Barclays’ U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.

“Yet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn’t show its low-cost model planned for 1H′25 production,” they added. “We also didn’t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.”

Piper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that “most trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.”

“We wouldn’t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,” the investment bank’s analysts said in the note.

Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank’s analysts noted that Musk didn’t mention any details on improvements to Tesla’s FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk’s AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports.

The event “overall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote in a note Friday.

“We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event,” they added.

It is expected to take some years still before self-driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads, with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles.

Among the few companies that have successfully launched self-driving cars on public roads is Google’s Waymo, which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June.",stocks,TSLA,"Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event — where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm’s Cybercab self-driving concept car — failed to impress investors.

In reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous driving future. “As expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla’s growth endeavors in AI/AV \[autonomous vehicles\],” Barclays’ U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday. “Yet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn’t show its low-cost model planned for 1H′25 production,” they added. “We also didn’t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.” Piper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that “most trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.” “We wouldn’t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,” the investment bank’s analysts said in the note. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank’s analysts noted that Musk didn’t mention any details on improvements to Tesla’s FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk’s AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports. The event “overall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote in a note Friday. “We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk loses bid to get $56 billion pay package reinstated,"A Delaware judge ruled on Monday that Tesla, CEO Elon Musk still is not entitled to receive a $56 billion compensation package despite shareholders of the electric vehicle company voting to reinstate it.The ruling by the judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery, follows her January decision that called the pay package excessive and rescinded it, surprising investors, and cast uncertainty over Musk's future at the world's most valuable carmaker.

Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for Musk, the company's driving force who is responsible for many of its advances, and reinstate his compensation.McCormick also ordered Tesla to pay the attorneys who brought the case $345 million, well short of the billions they initially requested.

Tesla shares close down 12% after earnings miss for biggest slump since 2020 ,"Tesla shares plummeted the most since 2020 after the electric vehicle maker reported weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings and another drop in automotive revenue.

The stock closed down 12% on Wednesday at $215.99. It’s now down 13% for the year, while the Nasdaq is up 16% over that stretch.

Tesla on Tuesday said auto revenue declined 7% from a year earlier to $19.9 billion while margins also fell. Total revenue increased 2% to $25.5 billion.

The company has been forced to slash prices globally and offer discounts and incentives as it faces slowing sales and rising competition, especially in China.

Tesla remains the top seller of electric vehicles in the U.S. by far, but is losing market share to a growing number of rivals due in part to its aging lineup of sedans and SUVs and the impact of Musk’s incendiary and political commentary.

Adjusted earnings of 52 cents a share for the second quarter trailed the average analyst estimate of 62 cents, according to LSEG. And Tesla’s adjusted operating margin shrank to the lowest in three years, dropping to 14.4% from 18.7% a year earlier. It’s the fourth straight quarter of shrinkage.

Investors have been focused on a number of other areas around the Tesla story, including when the company will introduce a new mass-market car to reinvigorate its lineup of vehicles. Musk said on the earnings call Tuesday that Tesla is on track to deliver a new “affordable” car in the first half of next year.

Robotaxis were a big topic on the earnings call. Musk envisions a world in which owners can authorize their Tesla vehicle to be used as part of an Uber-style ride-hailing service, with the cars driving autonomously.

When asked when he expects the first robotaxi ride, Musk said, “I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.”

Musk has a history of promising things on a particular timeline and not delivering. On Tuesday, he pushed back the date of the company’s robotaxi event to October, after previously saying it would take place in August.

“This is because I wanted to make some important changes that I think would improve the vehicle,” Musk said, adding that Tesla is “going to show up a couple of other things.” He didn’t provide details.

Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress","Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event — where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm’s Cybercab self-driving concept car — failed to impress investors.

Tesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.

Musk revealed Tesla’s Cybercab concept vehicle — a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals — on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.

The Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.

He also said he expects Tesla to have “unsupervised FSD” up and running in Texas and California next year in the company’s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla’s premium driver assistance system, available today in a “supervised” version for Tesla electric vehicles.

The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

In reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous driving future.

“As expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla’s growth endeavors in AI/AV \[autonomous vehicles\],” Barclays’ U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.

“Yet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn’t show its low-cost model planned for 1H′25 production,” they added. “We also didn’t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.”

Piper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that “most trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.”

“We wouldn’t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,” the investment bank’s analysts said in the note.

Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank’s analysts noted that Musk didn’t mention any details on improvements to Tesla’s FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk’s AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports.

The event “overall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote in a note Friday.

“We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event,” they added.

It is expected to take some years still before self-driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads, with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles.

Among the few companies that have successfully launched self-driving cars on public roads is Google’s Waymo, which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June.",stocks,Tesla,"Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event — where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm’s Cybercab self-driving concept car — failed to impress investors.

Musk lays off Tesla senior executives,"Elon Musk has dismissed two Tesla senior executives and plans to lay off hundreds more employees, frustrated by falling sales and the pace of job cuts so far, The Information reported on Tuesday, citing the CEO’s email to senior managers.

Rebecca Tinucci, senior director of the electric vehicle maker’s Supercharger business, and Daniel Ho, head of the new vehicles program, will leave on Tuesday morning, the report said.

Musk also plans to dismiss everyone working for Tinucci and Ho, including the roughly 500 employees who work in the Supercharger group, The Information said. It was not clear how many employees worked for Ho.

Tesla’s public policy team, which was led by former executive Rohan Patel, will also be dissolved, the report said.

“Hopefully these actions are making it clear that we need to be absolutely hard core about headcount and cost reduction,” Musk wrote in the email, the report said. “While some on exec staff are taking this seriously, most are not yet doing so.”

Tesla, which had 140,473 employees globally as of end-2023, did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment.

Ho joined Tesla in 2013 and was a program manager in the development of the Model S, the 3, and the Y before being put in charge of all new vehicles, while Tinucci joined in 2018 as a senior product manager, according to their LinkedIn profiles.

Two other senior leaders — Patel and battery development chief Drew Baglino — announced their departures earlier this month, when Tesla also ordered the layoffs of more than 10% of its workforce.

Tesla is grappling with falling sales and an intensifying price war, which led to its quarterly revenue falling for the first time since 2020, the company reported last week.

Musk made progress towards rolling out Tesla’s advanced driver-assistance package in China, the epicenter of the EV price war, during a surprise visit to Beijing on Sunday.

That trip came just over a week after he scrapped a planned trip to India, where Tesla has long sought to start operations, due to “very heavy Tesla obligations.”

""*Wall Street’s stance on Tesla Inc. worsened further on Wednesday as yet another analyst warned about risks to sales, and said its strategy of cutting prices to boost demand was losing its effectiveness.*  
*The electric vehicle maker’s growth in its core markets has moderated, Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan wrote in a note to clients Wednesday, as he downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a sell rating. Langan expects Tesla’s sales volumes to be flat this year and to fall in 2025.* 

*Elon Musk’s company is a “growth company with no growth,” Langan wrote. He highlighted that sales volumes rose only 3% in the second half of 2023 from the first half, while prices fell 5%.*

Elon Musk’s support for Trump pushes a corporate customer away from Tesla ,"European drugstore giant Rossmann announced Tuesday it will no longer buy Tesla’s electric vehicles for its fleet, effective immediately, citing CEO Elon Musk’s pro-Trump political support.

Rossmann, based in Germany, said in a statement that its decision was “based on the incompatibility between the statements of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the values ​​that Tesla represents with its products.”

“Elon Musk makes no secret of his support for Donald Trump,” Raoul Rossmann, a spokesperson for the company, said in a statement. “Trump has repeatedly described climate change as a hoax - this attitude is in stark contrast to Tesla’s mission to contribute to environmental protection through the production of electric cars.”

While Rossmann only purchases about 180 electric vehicles a year — and only had 38 Teslas in its fleet according to Bloomberg — the company’s decision to cut all Tesla EV purchases shows that Musk’s political decisions have begun to impact the automaker well beyond the U.S.

Musk formally endorsed Trump last month, and said he was contributing funds to a pro-Trump group he helped create called America PAC. Musk is also slated to interview the former president, Trump announced on Tuesday.

During a debate with President Biden in June, former President Trump dodged questions about what he would do, if anything, to combat climate change. And Trump has called climate change a “hoax.” He has also promised to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate agreement, as he did during his presidency, if he is re-elected in November.

According to ongoing research by Morning Consult, Republicans in the U.S. began to view Musk more favorably following his leveraged buyout of Twitter (now known as X) in late 2022. However, this has not driven an increase in Republican’s “purchasing consideration” of electric vehicles here. According to Pew Research, Musk’s reputation with left-leaning voters has declined even though they are far more likely to purchase an EV.

Rossman’s decision follows a recent survey that found a deterioration in Tesla’s brand, attributed partly to Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.” While Tesla’s revenue increased 2% during the second quarter, automotive revenue dropped 7% to $19.9 billion from $21.27 billion in the same quarter a year ago.

Tesla opened a factory in 2022 in Brandenburg, Germany (outside of Berlin) and employs thousands in the country. At the end of 2023, the drugstore chain Rossmann reported that it had more than 4,700 stores and more than 60,000 employees with about half in Germany.

Tesla has faced protests by environmental activists in Germany who took issue with the company’s plans to cut down part of a forest and to use water for manufacturing in Brandenburg. Musk lashed out at protesters there, saying on X in March they’re “either the dumbest eco-terrorists on Earth or they’re puppets of those who don’t have good environmental goals.”

Tesla, Musk and representatives for Rossmann did not respond to requests for further details on Thursday morning.

Tesla could find itself locked out of $7.5 billion in Biden administration subsidies if it fails to open its EV charging network up to competitors, according to a Reuters report.

The automaker's SuperCharger network has more stations in the US than any other charging company, but they can connnect only to plugs used by Tesla cars.

 ""We do understand that Tesla is looking to tweak their system to be more open access. So, if they do reach that point and meet those eligibility requirements, they certainly will be eligible for funding,"" Stuart Anderson, head of Iowa's transportation development division, told Reuters.

Tesla has already had a boost from the Biden administration's EV push in February, when the DOT tweaked its $7,500 tax credit consumer incentive plan to include more eligible models by expanding the definition of an SUV. That increased the potential demand for some of Tesla's models. 

Tesla CEO Elon Musk met with two White House officials last month to discuss ramping up EV production and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which includes the legislation on charging equipment.

"Tesla sells 1% of cars globally, yet is priced more than the companies combined that sell the other 99%","The valuation on Tesla is now beyond the absurd.  

Whilst European EV sales explode to presently 19% of all car sales this year, Tesla does not even make the top five EV sellers by company at a lowly 7%. (VW 25%; Stellantis 13%; Daimler 10%; BMW 10%; Hyundia-Kia 9%).

Tesla, unlike in the US, is simply being outsold by the vast array of alternative BEV models on sale particularly.  VW group alone offers the e-up, ID3 and ID4 (ID5 not yet on sale); Audi e-tron, e-tron Sportback e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT; Cupra Born; and Skoda Enyaq

In China Tesla has been pushed into 3rd place this year by BYD which has seen EV sales grow from 53K Q1; 98K.Q2; 183K Q3.  Tesla meanwhile has seen China quarterly sales for 2021 flattish at 69K, 62K and 75K.  China will likely sell 3 million EV's this year, half the worlds volume and Tesla sales are flat for the year.  Tesla might sell a lowly 9%.

Tesla dominates the US markets of course, where few EV models are on sale.  EV sales might be 3% of automotive sales.

Whilst investors will assert these stats do not.matter and Tesla's valuation is all about  tech, batteries and robo-taxis, it still does not sell any car related tech beyond its own cars.  Take up of FSD is a lowly 11%.  It still buys it's battery cells.  By its own statements it has a level 2/3 driver assist whilst companies like Waymo are already starting to offer level 4/5 robo-taxis in cities like San Fran (a free trial program has commenced).

Tesla net income and earnings drop more than 20% from last year,"Tesla reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings per share: 85 cents adj. vs 85 cents expected, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv

Revenue: $23.33 billion vs $23.21 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates

Net income came in at $2.51 billion, down 24% from last year, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.73, down 23% from the year-ago quarter.

Automotive revenue, Tesla’s core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter.

Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.

The company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures.

Revenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.

Tesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.


Shareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management’s consideration were seeking updates on the company’s trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company’s energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.

In early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.

A month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day’s drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas. And more recently, Tesla said it plans to set up a factory to make Megapacks, or large lithium ion battery-based energy storage systems, in Shanghai.

According to a financial filing published in late January, Tesla expected to spend between $7 billion and $9 billion in 2024 and 2025, an increase in capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the next two years.

Tesla shares have rebounded this year from a dismal 2022, when they lost about two-thirds of their value alongside a plunge in tech companies. The stock is up 48% in 2023.

Also over the last year, anyone betting against the FAANG+M stocks would have been decimated.

So why is the Popular Meme stock so important? If Apple market cap goes down 1 percent it probably same loss as the shorts had against the popular stock.

Tesla is Completely out of Touch with Needs of Taxi Services. ,"Seeing a lot of focus on the Temu Boston Dynamics bot, but not a lot of discussion on the robo taxi. 

How this thing is built tells me how out of touch and unprepared Tesla is to seriously compete in ride servicing. 

First off this thing has two seats, that alone is such a dumb design decision. It had to be Elon that said to keep it as two seats so it looks futuristic and aesthetic. What if I want to travel with a small group of people? I’m not using the LAX shuttle van at that point, I’m immediately turning to a competitor. Haven’t really seen anyone comment on how out of touch and unnecessary that was. 

One other concern I have is how Tesla primarily uses cameras. What if there are sirens and a fire truck, ambulance, or police car is blowing through an intersection. Other autonomous vehicles incorporate sound, I’m not too sure Tesla does. If not it sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. 

Beyond this there’s the ridiculous price tag he put on it which it’ll probably be nowhere close to. 

What are other people’s thoughts on this, did anything with this Robotaxi actually look like a feasible product to you? It looks like an aesthetic toy, but not an actual product that can compete in the space. Based on my understanding of a typical car design cycle, redesigning this to add four instead of just 2 seats would take probably another 2-4 years at least. To me it seems like they really just showed they lost on their biggest bet in the near future. 


Edit: Alright read through the comments, and still think the 2 seat no steering wheel design is stupid. People are saying this is meant to also be a personal commuter car. So my choices are to buy a 30K Robotaxi (knowing Tesla’s history this WILL be priced higher) and then ALSO get a model 3 or model Y to drive around my family for ANOTHER 40K when I can just get ONE model 3 or any other self driving car, no Robotaxi and do everything I need? How is that budget friendly at all, and if there’s a nicer car with a steering wheel that self drives why would I buy something without the option of a steering wheel? 
Still a toy.
 
Also, if it’s for personal use, how does this know where to park at my office or how to get past a security gate to private property? If I live in a condo building with a garage how does it know how to get out of the parking garage and where my parking space is? It makes no sense as a personal car for a LOT of people.

And even if the majority of taxi rides are 1-2 people, why not just use a model 3 that’s 10K more, already exists, and can service that additional 15-20% of your taxi market (given the Robotaxi is definitely not gonna cost 30K and over the life of the car the extra seats pay for themselves). You also save on all the costs that it took to make a stupid 2 seater when it came to expanding production lines/capacity, testing, and designing the pointless thing. 

My opinion doesn’t change this thing shouldn’t exist, and it’s out of touch with what most people need. Total waste of time when they could’ve focused on actually competing with growing competition in the normal car space where they’re losing their competitive advantage. There’s a reason why Uber and the ex-Waymo CEO were not impressed.",stocks,Tesla,"Tesla is Completely out of Touch with Needs of Taxi Services.

"Musk now says it's 'pointless' to build a $25,000 Tesla for human drivers","So, will there be any new car model for Tesla in 2025???

&#x200B;

**Musk now says it's 'pointless' to build a $25,000 Tesla for human drivers**  
[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-now-says-its-pointless-build-25000-tesla-human-drivers-2024-11-05](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-now-says-its-pointless-build-25000-tesla-human-drivers-2024-11-05)

&#x200B;

*When Reuters reported in April that Tesla had scrapped plans for a long-promised, next-generation $25,000 electric vehicle, the automaker’s stock plunged. Chief Executive Elon Musk rushed to respond on X, his social-media network.*  
*“Reuters is lying,” he posted, without elaborating. Tesla’s stock recovered some of its losses.*  
*Six months later, Musk appears to have backed into an admission that Tesla dropped its plans for a human-driven $25,000 car. He said in an Oct. 23 earnings call that building the affordable EV would be ""pointless” unless the car was fully autonomous.*  
*His latest remarks came in response to an investor asking: “When can we expect Tesla to give us the $25,000 non-robotaxi regular car model?”*  
*Musk responded: “We’re not making a non-robo…,” before he was interrupted by another Tesla executive. Musk later added: “Basically, I think having a regular $25K model is pointless. It would be silly.”*  
*The April 5 Reuters article reported that Tesla had abandoned plans for an all-new, affordable mass-market EV but still planned a self-driving robotaxi. Since then, Musk has increasingly touted plans for robotaxis and autonomous vehicles.*  
*Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment for this story.*  
*On the October earnings call, Musk said that Tesla does plan a “$25K car” – its “Cybercab,” a two-door, two-seat, fully autonomous vehicle. Musk unveiled a prototype at a Hollywood-style event on Oct. 10.*  
*Musk says Tesla will start production of the Cybercab in 2026, after it deploys fully autonomous versions of its current Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Texas and California next year. The automaker faces steep technological, regulatory and legal challenges in delivering on Musk’s latest promises of fully autonomous vehicles, which echo others dating back about a decade.*  
*An all-new affordable Tesla for human drivers had until recently been a linchpin of Tesla’s strategy to become the world’s biggest automaker. For several years, Tesla had a goal of producing 20 million vehicles a year by 2030, more than tenfold what it sells now and nearly double that of Toyota, the current global sales leader. In May, Tesla dropped the 20-million goal from its latest “impact report” on progress toward sustainability goals.*  
*As recently as January of this year, Musk confirmed the plan for an all-new affordable EV in an earnings call. He said the next-generation vehicle would arrive in 2025 and launch a second major ""growth wave,” following the first wave with the release of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in 2017 and 2020, respectively.*  
*Investors and Tesla fans commonly called the anticipated cheap car a “Model 2,” slotting in below the Model 3, currently the least-expensive Tesla, starting at $42,490.*  
*In January, Musk described the all-new model as requiring “new revolutionary manufacturing technology.” But in April, after Reuters reported Tesla had scrapped the Model 2, Musk outlined a plan for “more affordable” models that could be produced “on the same manufacturing lines” as current Teslas.*  
*Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar Research Services analyst, said he believes these less-expensive vehicles will be built on current Tesla platforms and priced in the mid-$30,000s.*  
*“It was my understanding that the original plan was to make the more-affordable vehicle on a new platform,” he told Reuters. “I think Tesla realized they were late to making an affordable vehicle versus their Chinese-EV peers … So, they changed their strategy rather than make a large investment to produce a new vehicle.”*  
*After the April 5 Reuters report that Tesla had killed the Model 2, Musk posted that day on X saying Tesla planned a “robotaxi unveil” in August. The event, delayed until October and held on a movie set near Los Angeles, underwhelmed Wall Street and drove a 9% drop in Tesla shares the following day.*  
*Some investors viewed Musk’s comments on the Cybercab – along with displays of an autonomous “Robovan” concept and humanoid robots – as short on concrete details about the products. Tesla hasn’t said whether the Cybercab will feature new self-driving technology beyond the company’s “Full Self-Driving” feature in its current vehicles. Its existing models can’t fully drive themselves and require a human driver paying strict attention.*  
*The target market for the Cybercab isn’t clear. The Cybercab’s sports-car looks and two-door, two-seat configuration – a nearly extinct layout in the wider U.S. auto market – puzzled some analysts who expected a robotaxi with more room for passengers and luggage.*  
*Musk, in the October earnings call, said the concept vehicle’s design was “optimized for autonomy” and would also deliver affordability.*  
*“It will cost … roughly 25K, so it is a 25K car,” Musk said. “It just won't have a steering wheel and pedals.”*",stocks,Tesla,"Musk now says it's 'pointless' to build a $25,000 Tesla for human drivers So, will there be any new car model for Tesla in 2025??? &; **Musk now says it's 'pointless' to build a $25,000 Tesla for human drivers** [ &; *When Reuters reported in April that Tesla had scrapped plans for a long-promised, next-generation $25,000 electric vehicle, the automaker’s stock plunged.

"Tesla reports 386,810 deliveries in the first quarter of 2024, produced 433,371 vehicles ","Tesla just published its first-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report for 2024. Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q1 2024: 386,810
Total production Q1 2024: 433,371

Tesla doesn’t break out sales of its vehicles by model but reported that it produced 412,376 Model 3/Y cars and delivered 369,783 of those cars. It produced 20,995 of its other models and delivered 17,027.

In the same period last year, the electric automaker reported 422,875 deliveries and production of 440,808 vehicles. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Tesla reported 484,507 deliveries and production of 494,989 vehicles.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company’s shareholder communications.

According to a mean of 11 estimates compiled by FactSet, analysts were expecting deliveries of around 457,000 for the period ending March 31. Estimates ranged from a high of 511,000 deliveries to a low of 414,000 for the first quarter, with estimates updated in March ranging from 414,000 to 469,000 deliveries.

Independent auto industry researcher Troy Teslike, whose work is closely followed by Tesla fans, had expected deliveries to come in around 409,000.

Tesla’s head of investor relations Martin Viecha sent around a company-compiled consensus based on 30 analysts’ estimates over the weekend to select investors. The consensus, which was viewed by CNBC, said analysts were expecting a mean of 443,027 deliveries and a median of 431,125 deliveries for the quarter.

Tesla faced numerous challenges in the first quarter.

Houthi militia attacks on shippers in the Red Sea disrupted Tesla’s component supply and temporarily suspended production at its German factory outside of Berlin in January. In March, environmental activists set fire to infrastructure near that same factory, depriving Tesla of sufficient operation power and again causing a pause in production.

In China, Tesla faced an onslaught of competition from domestic EV makers, including BYD and newcomers such as the phone maker Xiaomi. After sluggish sales numbers for its China-made cars in January and February, Tesla reduced production of its Model 3 and Model Y at its Shanghai plant and slashed workers’ schedules to 5 days a week from 6 and a half days.

In the U.S., reviews were mixed for Tesla’s newest model — an angular pickup dubbed the Cybertruck — which the EV maker only began to sell in small numbers in December last year.

A series of discounts and incentives appeared to be less effective in driving sales volume than in the past for Tesla.

During the final days of the first quarter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk mandated that all sales and service staff install and demo the newest version of the company’s premium driver assistance system for customers in North America before handing over their cars. The system is marketed as Full Self-Driving but doesn’t make Tesla cars autonomous. They require a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

Shares of Tesla dropped 29% in the first quarter, the biggest decline since the end of 2022 and the third-steepest quarterly plunge since the company’s IPO in 2010.

During the final days of the first quarter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk mandated that all sales and service staff install and demo the newest version of the company’s premium driver assistance system for customers in North America before handing over their cars. The system is marketed as Full Self-Driving but doesn’t make Tesla cars autonomous. They require a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time. Shares of Tesla dropped 29% in the first quarter, the biggest decline since the end of 2022 and the third-steepest quarterly plunge since the company’s IPO in 2010. Source:",0.029416666666666667,1

Tesla cuts U.S. prices for fifth time since January.,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/07/tesla-cuts-us-prices-for-fifth-time-since-january.html

Tesla cut prices in the United States between 2% and nearly 6%, its website showed on Thursday, as the company extends a discount drive on its electric vehicles that analysts caution could hurt profitability. The fifth such cut in Tesla’s largest market since the start of the year comes as the United States prepares to adopt tougher standards this month that are expected to limit EV tax credits. Tesla cut prices on both versions of its Model 3 sedan by $1,000 and on its Model Y crossover by $2,000, the website showed. It also cut prices on both versions of its more expensive Model S and Model X by $5,000. The company has said the tougher U.S. standards would reduce the $7,500 tax credit available for its base, rear-wheel drive Model 3 since January.

Some analysts who expected the further price cuts had flagged concern that Tesla’s industry-leading profit margins could be at risk. This week Tesla reported first-quarter deliveries of almost 423,000 vehicles, up just 4% from the prior quarter after price cuts in the United States, China and other markets aiming to spur demand. Tesla has set a target of 1.8 million deliveries this year.

Tesla investor Ross Gerber says he's been dumping the stock because no one wants the company's cars or robots,"* Tesla stock is in a ""quagmire,"" the longtime investor Ross Gerber has said.
* He said he'd sold about $60 million in Tesla shares amid growing concerns over the carmaker.
* Gerber told Yahoo Finance that no one seemed interested in buying Tesla's cars anymore.

  
One of Tesla's longtime investors has dumped about half his stake in Elon Musk's carmaker.



The shareholder, Ross Gerber, has said that's because no one seems interested in buying Tesla's cars or robots.



Gerber, who's been a loud critic of Musk since the Tesla CEO acquired Twitter in 2022, said he had sold about 60 million worth of his Tesla shares. He told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview that his investment fund still had a $50 million stake in the company.



""Over time, I've just been sort of lowering my position, because I just don't have the same confidence that they're going to achieve the goals that were set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently, which is really to sell more cars,"" Gerber said, dismissing bullish talk on Tesla's robotics and full-self-driving tech. ""That's just a distraction from the fact that they need to sell cars, this year, and next year, and the year after, because none of this is coming anytime soon,"" he added.



Other Tesla investors have also grown skeptical and impatient over the car company's trajectory. Tesla's stock is down 13% this year, largely because of declining sales, rising competition in China, and drama surrounding Musk's legal battles.



Gerber said the used-car market was swarmed with old Teslas, adding that he'd been unable to offload his own Tesla at what he deemed a fair value.



""It's really a quagmire where you have the best products in an industry but a CEO who doesn't actually work there, who doesn't try to sell the cars,"" Gerber said, adding: ""We've seen sales go down, and that's what's happening. Sales are going down. If you're expecting a great quarter, you're wrong. They're not selling any Teslas here, other than basically, discount, discount, discount.""



And while analysts have made the case that the company is being undervalued as an AI firm, Gerber said artificial intelligence was unlikely to save the company. He speculated that demand would be poor for Tesla's humanoid robots, given doubts over Musk amid his chaotic revamp of Twitter into X.



""The simplest way to do it is, go around to your neighbors and ask them, 'How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk?' And the answer is zero, OK. Nobody wants a robot from Elon Musk. Why? Who would trust it?"" Gerber said, adding: ""The last thing I need is some robot built by Elon Musk in my house, so I don't know if they thought about the marketing of this at all yet.""



Musk's leadership of Tesla has been under rising scrutiny from investors and lawmakers over the past few years. Most recently, Sen. Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Tesla's board of directors, calling on the executives to ensure Musk was meeting his financial responsibilities to Tesla shareholders.

"California plan excludes Tesla from new EV tax credits, governor's office says","Tesla's electric vehicles likely would not qualify for California's new state tax credits under a proposal in the works if President-elect Donald Trump scraps the federal tax credit for EV purchases, Governor Gavin Newsom's office said on Monday.
Tesla shares closed down 4%.

Trump's transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of $7,500 for EV purchases, Reuters reported this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser, sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response ""Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.""

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

"Tesla reports 443,956 deliveries in second quarter, a 4.8% decrease from last year ","Tesla just posted its second-quarter vehicle production and deliveries numbers for 2024.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q2 2024: 443,956 vehicles

Total production Q2 2024: 410,831 vehicles

Tesla’s numbers beat Wall Street estimates. Analysts expected Tesla deliveries to hit 439,000 in the three months ending June 30, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by FactSet Street Account. The total number of deliveries in the second quarter was down 4.8% from 466,140 a year earlier.

Troy Teslike, an independent researcher widely followed by Tesla fans, predicted deliveries of 423,000 for the quarter.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the electric vehicle maker. Tesla groups deliveries into two categories — Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, and all other vehicles — but doesn’t report numbers for individual models or specific regions.

Tesla’s current lineup includes its popular Model Y crossover utility vehicles, Model 3 sedans and the new Cybertruck pickups, as well as the Model X SUV and flagship Model S sedan.

In April, Tesla reported a drop of 8.5% in first-quarter deliveries to 386,810, the first annual decline since 2020. Weeks later the company reported 13% decline in year-over-year revenue for the quarter, “primarily due to lower average selling price.”

Sluggish sales were in part the result of temporary factory shut downs initiated in response to an alleged arson attack at Tesla’s factory in Germany, as well as shipping delays following Red Sea conflicts, Tesla said.

But the sales drop also correlated with Tesla’s aging lineup of vehicles, increased competition from other EV makers especially in China, and brand erosion that one recent survey attributed partly to CEO Elon Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.”

Tesla shares are down 16% in 2024 even after rallying 6% on Monday.

Tesla has offered a range of discounts and other incentives this year to try spur sales.

In China, Tesla is currently offering a zero-interest loan as an incentive to get customers to buy a Model 3 or Model Y by July 31. According to its 2023 annual filing, Tesla generated about $21.75 billion of its overall revenue from China, representing 22.5% of total sales.

Colin Langan, an analyst at Wells Fargo, issued a report on Monday, saying the firm sees “declining delivery growth driven by lower demand & diminished return on price cuts.” He recommends selling Tesla shares.

Wells Fargo expects automotive gross margins at Tesla, not including environmental credits, to fall given the “likelihood of more price cuts & lower volumes” as the year continues.

Investor focus will now shift to Tesla’s second-quarter earnings report later this month, and a separate marketing event planned for August, when the company intends to reveal its design for a dedicated robotaxi or “CyberCab.”

Source: Tesla rigged the dashboard to overstate battery range; created a “Diversion Team” to suppress thousands of complaints,"In March, Alexandre Ponsin set out on a family road trip from Colorado to California in his newly purchased Tesla, a used 2021 Model 3. He expected to get something close to the electric sport sedan’s advertised driving range: 353 miles on a fully charged battery.

He soon realized he was sometimes getting less than half that much range, particularly in cold weather – such severe underperformance that he was convinced the car had a serious defect.

“We’re looking at the range, and you literally see the number decrease in front of your eyes,” he said of his dashboard range meter.

Ponsin contacted Tesla and booked a service appointment in California. He later received two text messages, telling him that “remote diagnostics” had determined his battery was fine, and then: “We would like to cancel your visit.”

What Ponsin didn’t know was that Tesla employees had been instructed to thwart any customers complaining about poor driving range from bringing their vehicles in for service. Last summer, the company quietly created a “Diversion Team” in Las Vegas to cancel as many range-related appointments as possible.

The Austin, Texas-based electric carmaker deployed the team because its service centers were inundated with appointments from owners who had expected better performance based on the company’s advertised estimates and the projections displayed by the in-dash range meters of the cars themselves, according to several people familiar with the matter.

Inside the Nevada team’s office, some employees celebrated canceling service appointments by putting their phones on mute and striking a metal xylophone, triggering applause from coworkers who sometimes stood on desks. The team often closed hundreds of cases a week and staffers were tracked on their average number of diverted appointments per day.

Managers told the employees that they were saving Tesla about $1,000 for every canceled appointment, the people said. Another goal was to ease the pressure on service centers, some of which had long waits for appointments.

In most cases, the complaining customers’ cars likely did not need repair, according to the people familiar with the matter. Rather, Tesla created the groundswell of complaints another way – by hyping the range of its futuristic electric vehicles, or EVs, raising consumer expectations beyond what the cars can deliver. Teslas often fail to achieve their advertised range estimates and the projections provided by the cars’ own equipment, according to Reuters interviews with three automotive experts who have tested or studied the company’s vehicles.

Neither Tesla nor Chief Executive Elon Musk responded to detailed questions from Reuters for this story.

Reuters reporter Steve Stecklow discusses how Tesla has been exaggerating the driving range of its vehicles for years.
Tesla years ago began exaggerating its vehicles’ potential driving distance – by rigging their range-estimating software. The company decided about a decade ago, for marketing purposes, to write algorithms for its range meter that would show drivers “rosy” projections for the distance it could travel on a full battery, according to a person familiar with an early design of the software for its in-dash readouts.

Then, when the battery fell below 50% of its maximum charge, the algorithm would show drivers more realistic projections for their remaining driving range, this person said. To prevent drivers from getting stranded as their predicted range started declining more quickly, Teslas were designed with a “safety buffer,” allowing about 15 miles (24 km) of additional range even after the dash readout showed an empty battery, the source said.

The directive to present the optimistic range estimates came from Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, this person said.

“Elon wanted to show good range numbers when fully charged,” the person said, adding: “When you buy a car off the lot seeing 350-mile, 400-mile range, it makes you feel good.”

Tesla’s intentional inflation of in-dash range-meter projections and the creation of its range-complaints diversion team have not been previously reported.

Driving range is among the most important factors in consumer decisions on which electric car to buy, or whether to buy one at all. So-called range anxiety – the fear of running out of power before reaching a charger – has been a primary obstacle to boosting electric-vehicle sales.

At the time Tesla programmed in the rosy range projections, it was selling only two models: the two-door Roadster, its first vehicle, which was later discontinued; and the Model S, a luxury sport sedan launched in 2012. It now sells four models: two cars, the 3 and S; and two crossover SUVs, the X and Y. Tesla plans the return of the Roadster, along with a “Cybertruck” pickup.

Reuters could not determine whether Tesla still uses algorithms that boost in-dash range estimates. But automotive testers and regulators continue to flag the company for exaggerating the distance its vehicles can travel before their batteries run out.

Tesla was fined earlier this year by South Korean regulators who found the cars delivered as little as half their advertised range in cold weather. Another recent study found that three Tesla models averaged 26% below their advertised ranges.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has required Tesla since the 2020 model year to reduce the range estimates the automaker wanted to advertise for six of its vehicles by an average of 3%. The EPA told Reuters, however, that it expects some variation between the results of separate tests conducted by automakers and the agency.

Data collected in 2022 and 2023 from more than 8,000 Teslas by Recurrent, a Seattle-based EV analytics company, showed that the cars’ dashboard range meters didn’t change their estimates to reflect hot or cold outside temperatures, which can greatly reduce range.

Recurrent found that Tesla’s four models almost always calculated that they could travel more than 90% of their advertised EPA range estimates regardless of external temperatures. Scott Case, Recurrent’s chief executive, told Reuters that Tesla’s range meters also ignore many other conditions affecting driving distance.

Electric cars can lose driving range for a lot of the same reasons as gasoline cars — but to a greater degree. The cold is a particular drag on EVs, slowing the chemical and physical reactions inside their batteries and requiring a heating system to protect them. Other drains on the battery include hilly terrain, headwinds, a driver’s lead foot and running the heating or air-conditioning inside the cabin.

Tesla discusses the general effect of such conditions in a “Range Tips” section of its website. The automaker also recently updated its vehicle software to provide a breakdown of battery consumption during recent trips with suggestions on how range might have been improved.

Tesla vehicles provide range estimates in two ways: One through a dashboard meter of current range that’s always on, and a second projection through its navigation system, which works when a driver inputs a specific destination. The navigation system’s range estimate, Case said, does account for a wider set of conditions, including temperature. While those estimates are “more realistic,” they still tend to overstate the distance the car can travel before it needs to be recharged, he said.

Recurrent tested other automakers’ in-dash range meters –  including the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Chevrolet Bolt and the Hyundai Kona – and found them to be more accurate. The Kona’s range meter generally underestimated the distance the car could travel, the tests showed. Recurrent conducted the study with the help of a National Science Foundation grant.

Tesla, Case said, has consistently designed the range meters in its cars to deliver aggressive rather than conservative estimates: “That’s where Tesla has taken a different path from most other automakers.”

Failed tests and false advertising

Tesla isn’t the only automaker with cars that don’t regularly achieve their advertised ranges.

One of the experts, Gregory Pannone, co-authored a study of 21 different brands of electric vehicles, published in April by SAE International, an engineering organization. The research found that, on average, the cars fell short of their advertised ranges by 12.5% in highway driving.

The study did not name the brands tested, but Pannone told Reuters that three Tesla models posted the worst performance, falling short of their advertised ranges by an average of 26%.

The EV pioneer pushes the limits of government testing regulations that govern the claims automakers put on window stickers, the three automotive experts told Reuters.

Like their gas-powered counterparts, new electric vehicles are required by U.S. federal law to display a label with fuel-efficiency information. In the case of EVs, this is stated in miles-per-gallon equivalent (MPGe), allowing consumers to compare them to gasoline or diesel vehicles. The labels also include estimates of total range: how far an EV can travel on a full charge, in combined city and highway driving.

“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests.”

EV makers have a choice in how to calculate a model’s range. They can use a standard EPA formula that converts fuel-economy results from city and highway driving tests to calculate a total range figure. Or automakers can conduct additional tests to come up with their own range estimate. The only reason to conduct more tests is to generate a more favorable estimate, said Pannone, a retired auto-industry veteran.

Tesla conducts additional range tests on all of its models. By contrast, many other automakers, including Ford, Mercedes and Porsche, continue to rely on the EPA’s formula to calculate potential range, according to agency data for 2023 models. That generally produces more conservative estimates, Pannone said.

Mercedes-Benz told Reuters it uses the EPA’s formula because it believes it provides a more accurate estimate. “We follow a certification strategy that reflects the real-world driving behavior of our customers in the best possible way,” the German carmaker said in a statement.

Ford and Porsche didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Whatever an automaker decides, the EPA must approve the window-sticker numbers. The agency told Reuters it conducts its own tests on 15% to 20% of new electric vehicles each year as part of an audit program and has tested six Tesla models since the 2020 model year.

EPA data obtained by Reuters through the Freedom of Information Act showed that the audits resulted in Tesla being required to lower all the cars’ estimated ranges by an average of 3%. The projected range for one vehicle, the 2021 Model Y Long Range AWD (all-wheel drive), dropped by 5.15%. The EPA said all the changes to Tesla’s range estimates were made before the company used the figures on window stickers.

The EPA said it has seen “everything” in its audits of EV manufacturers’ range testing, including low and high estimates from other automakers. “That is what we expect when we have new manufacturers and new technologies entering the market  and why EPA prioritizes” auditing them, the agency said.

The EPA cautioned that individuals’ actual experience with vehicle efficiency might differ from the estimates the agency approves. Independent automotive testers commonly examine the EPA-approved fuel-efficiency or driving range claims against their own experience in structured tests or real-world driving. Often, they get different results, as in the case of Tesla vehicles.

Pannone called Tesla “the most aggressive” electric-vehicle manufacturer when it comes to range calculations.

“I’m not suggesting they’re cheating,” Pannone said of Tesla. “What they’re doing, at least minimally, is leveraging the current procedures more than the other manufacturers.”

Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director for the automotive website Edmunds.com, reached a similar conclusion to Pannone after an extensive examination of vehicles from Tesla and other major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Hyundai and Porsche.

All five Tesla models tested by Edmunds failed to achieve their advertised range, the website reported in February 2021. All but one of 10 other models from other manufacturers exceeded their advertised range.

Tesla complained to Edmunds that the test failed to account for the safety buffer programmed into Tesla’s in-dash range meters. So Edmunds did further testing, this time running the vehicles, as Tesla requested, past the point where their range meters indicated the batteries had run out.

Only two of six Teslas tested matched their advertised range, Edmunds reported in March 2021. The tests found no fixed safety buffer.

Edmunds has continued to test electric vehicles, using its own standard method, to see if they meet their advertised range estimates. As of July, no Tesla vehicle had, Elfalan said.

“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests,” Elfalan told Reuters. The practice can “misrepresent what their customers will experience with their vehicles.”

South Korean regulators earlier this year fined Tesla about $2.1 million for falsely advertised driving ranges on its local website between August 2019 and December 2022. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) found that Tesla failed to tell customers that cold weather can drastically reduce its cars’ range. It cited tests by the country’s environment ministry that showed Tesla cars lost up to 50.5% of the company’s claimed ranges in cold weather.

The KFTC also flagged certain statements on Tesla’s website, including one that claimed about a particular model: “You can drive 528 km (328 miles) or longer on a single charge.” Regulators required Tesla to remove the “or longer” phrase.

Korean regulators required Tesla to publicly admit it had misled consumers. Musk and two local executives did so in a June 19 statement, acknowledging “false/exaggerated advertising.”

Creating a diversion

By last year, sales of Tesla’s electric vehicles were surging. The company delivered about 1.3 million cars in 2022, nearly 13 times more than five years before.

As sales grew, so did demand for service appointments. The wait for an available booking was sometimes a month, according to one of the sources familiar with the diversion team’s operations.

Tesla instructs owners to book appointments through a phone app. The company found that many problems could be handled by its “virtual” service teams, who can remotely diagnose and fix various issues.

Tesla supervisors told some virtual team members to steer customers away from bringing their cars into service whenever possible. One current Tesla “Virtual Service Advisor” described part of his job in his LinkedIn profile: “Divert customers who do not require in person service.”

Such advisors handled a variety of issues, including range complaints. But last summer, Tesla created the Las Vegas “Diversion Team” to handle only range cases, according to the people familiar with the matter.

The office atmosphere at times resembled that of a telemarketing boiler room. A supervisor had purchased the metallophone – a xylophone with metal keys – that employees struck to celebrate appointment cancellations, according to the people familiar with the office’s operations.

Advisers would normally run remote diagnostics on customers’ cars and try to call them, the people said. They were trained to tell customers that the EPA-approved range estimates were just a prediction, not an actual measurement, and that batteries degrade over time, which can reduce range. Advisors would offer tips on extending range by changing driving habits.

If the remote diagnostics found anything else wrong with the vehicle that was not related to driving range, advisors were instructed not to tell the customer, one of the sources said. Managers told them to close the cases.

Tesla also updated its phone app so that any customer who complained about range could no longer book service appointments, one of the sources said. Instead, they could request that someone from Tesla contact them. It often took several days before owners were contacted because of the large backlog of range complaints, the source said.


Tesla recently stopped owners from using its app to book service appointments relating to complaints about driving range. Instead, it gave them tips on increasing range and directed their inquiries to a “Diversion Team” tasked with preventing service-center visits.
The update routed all U.S. range complaints to the Nevada diversion team, which started in Las Vegas and later moved to the nearby suburb of Henderson. The team was soon fielding up to 2,000 cases a week, which sometimes included multiple complaints from customers frustrated they couldn't book a service appointment, one of the people said.

The team was expected to close about 750 cases a week. To accomplish that, office supervisors told advisers to call a customer once and, if there was no answer, to close the case as unresponsive, the source said. When customers did respond, advisers were told to try to complete the call in no more than five minutes.

In late 2022, managers aiming to quickly close cases told advisors to stop running remote diagnostic tests on the vehicles of owners who had reported range problems, according to one of the people familiar with the diversion team’s operations.

“Thousands of customers were told there is nothing wrong with their car” by advisors who had never run diagnostics, the person said.

Reuters could not establish how long the practice continued.

Tesla recently stopped using its diversion team in Nevada to handle range-related complaints, according to the person familiar with the matter. Virtual service advisors in an office in Utah are now handling range cases, the person said. Reuters could not determine why the change was made.


The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signs off on fuel economy and driving range estimates.

The EPA required Tesla to slightly lower driving range estimates that it planned to put on window stickers for six recent models after the agency’s own testing. But the EPA said such variation is not uncommon in testing by makers of electric vehicles.
On the road

By the time Alexandre Ponsin reached California on his March road trip, he had stopped to charge his Model 3’s battery about a dozen times.

Concerned that something was seriously wrong with the car, he had called and texted with several Tesla representatives. One of them booked the first available appointment in Santa Clara – about two weeks away – but advised him to show up at a Tesla service center as soon as he arrived in California.

Ponsin soon received a text saying that remote diagnostics had shown his battery “is in good health.”

“We would like to cancel your visit for now if you have no other concerns,” the text read.

“Of course I still have concerns,” Ponsin shot back. “I have 150 miles of range on a full charge!”

The next day, he received another text message asking him to cancel the appointment. “I am sorry, but no I do not want to close the service appointment as I do not feel my concerns have been addressed,” he replied.

Undeterred, Ponsin brought his car to the Santa Clara service center without an appointment. A technician there told him the car was fine. “It lasted 10 minutes,” Ponsin said, “and they didn’t even look at the car physically.”

After doing more research into range estimates, he said he ultimately concluded there is nothing wrong with his car. The problem, he said, was that Tesla is overstating its performance. He believes Tesla “should be a lot more explicit about the variation in the range,” especially in very cold weather.

“I do love my Tesla,” the engineer said. “But I have just tempered my expectation of what it can do in certain conditions.”",stocks,Tesla,"Source: Tesla rigged the dashboard to overstate battery range; created a “Diversion Team” to suppress thousands of complaints In March, Alexandre Ponsin set out on a family road trip from Colorado to California in his newly purchased Tesla, a used 2021 Model 3. He expected to get something close to the electric sport sedan’s advertised driving range: 353 miles on a fully charged battery. He soon realized he was sometimes getting less than half that much range, particularly in cold weather – such severe underperformance that he was convinced the car had a serious defect. “We’re looking at the range, and you literally see the number decrease in front of your eyes,” he said of his dashboard range meter. Ponsin contacted Tesla and booked a service appointment in California. He later received two text messages, telling him that “remote diagnostics” had determined his battery was fine, and then: “We would like to cancel your visit.” What Ponsin didn’t know was that Tesla employees had been instructed to thwart any customers complaining about poor driving range from bringing their vehicles in for service. Last summer, the company quietly created a “Diversion Team” in Las Vegas to cancel as many range-related appointments as possible. The Austin, Texas-based electric carmaker deployed the team because its service centers were inundated with appointments from owners who had expected better performance based on the company’s advertised estimates and the projections displayed by the in-dash range meters of the cars themselves, according to several people familiar with the matter. A Tesla logo shown outside a Beijing showroom. The automaker’s estimates of its electric vehicles’ driving range have been among the most aggressive in the industry. It has faced thousands of complaints from customers disappointed by the vehicles’ real-world performance. REUTERS/Thomas Peter Inside the Nevada team’s office, some employees celebrated canceling service appointments by putting their phones on mute and striking a metal xylophone, triggering applause from coworkers who sometimes stood on desks. The team often closed hundreds of cases a week and staffers were tracked on their average number of diverted appointments per day. Managers told the employees that they were saving Tesla about $1,000 for every canceled appointment, the people said. Another goal was to ease the pressure on service centers, some of which had long waits for appointments. In most cases, the complaining customers’ cars likely did not need repair, according to the people familiar with the matter. Rather, Tesla created the groundswell of complaints another way – by hyping the range of its futuristic electric vehicles, or EVs, raising consumer expectations beyond what the cars can deliver. Teslas often fail to achieve their advertised range estimates and the projections provided by the cars’ own equipment, according to Reuters interviews with three automotive experts who have tested or studied the company’s vehicles. Neither Tesla nor Chief Executive Elon Musk responded to detailed questions from Reuters for this story. Reuters reporter Steve Stecklow discusses how Tesla has been exaggerating the driving range of its vehicles for years. Tesla years ago began exaggerating its vehicles’ potential driving distance – by rigging their range-estimating software. The company decided about a decade ago, for marketing purposes, to write algorithms for its range meter that would show drivers “rosy” projections for the distance it could travel on a full battery, according to a person familiar with an early design of the software for its in-dash readouts. Then, when the battery fell below 50% of its maximum charge, the algorithm would show drivers more realistic projections for their remaining driving range, this person said. To prevent drivers from getting stranded as their predicted range started declining more quickly, Teslas were designed with a “safety buffer,” allowing about 15 miles (24 km) of additional range even after the dash readout showed an empty battery, the source said. The directive to present the optimistic range estimates came from Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, this person said. “Elon wanted to show good range numbers when fully charged,” the person said, adding: “When you buy a car off the lot seeing 350-mile, 400-mile range, it makes you feel good.” Tesla’s intentional inflation of in-dash range-meter projections and the creation of its range-complaints diversion team have not been previously reported. Driving range is among the most important factors in consumer decisions on which electric car to buy, or whether to buy one at all. So-called range anxiety – the fear of running out of power before reaching a charger – has been a primary obstacle to boosting electric-vehicle sales. At the time Tesla programmed in the rosy range projections, it was selling only two models: the two-door Roadster, its first vehicle, which was later discontinued; and the Model S, a luxury sport sedan launched in 2012. It now sells four models: two cars, the 3 and S; and two crossover SUVs, the X and Y. Tesla plans the return of the Roadster, along with a “Cybertruck” pickup. Reuters could not determine whether Tesla still uses algorithms that boost in-dash range estimates. But automotive testers and regulators continue to flag the company for exaggerating the distance its vehicles can travel before their batteries run out. Tesla was fined earlier this year by South Korean regulators who found the cars delivered as little as half their advertised range in cold weather. Another recent study found that three Tesla models averaged 26% below their advertised ranges. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has required Tesla since the 2020 model year to reduce the range estimates the automaker wanted to advertise for six of its vehicles by an average of 3%. The EPA told Reuters, however, that it expects some variation between the results of separate tests conducted by automakers and the agency. Data collected in 2022 and 2023 from more than 8,000 Teslas by Recurrent, a Seattle-based EV analytics company, showed that the cars’ dashboard range meters didn’t change their estimates to reflect hot or cold outside temperatures, which can greatly reduce range. Recurrent found that Tesla’s four models almost always calculated that they could travel more than 90% of their advertised EPA range estimates regardless of external temperatures. Scott Case, Recurrent’s chief executive, told Reuters that Tesla’s range meters also ignore many other conditions affecting driving distance. Electric cars can lose driving range for a lot of the same reasons as gasoline cars — but to a greater degree. The cold is a particular drag on EVs, slowing the chemical and physical reactions inside their batteries and requiring a heating system to protect them. Other drains on the battery include hilly terrain, headwinds, a driver’s lead foot and running the heating or air-conditioning inside the cabin. Tesla discusses the general effect of such conditions in a “Range Tips” section of its website. The automaker also recently updated its vehicle software to provide a breakdown of battery consumption during recent trips with suggestions on how range might have been improved. Tesla vehicles provide range estimates in two ways: One through a dashboard meter of current range that’s always on, and a second projection through its navigation system, which works when a driver inputs a specific destination. The navigation system’s range estimate, Case said, does account for a wider set of conditions, including temperature. While those estimates are “more realistic,” they still tend to overstate the distance the car can travel before it needs to be recharged, he said. Recurrent tested other automakers’ in-dash range meters – including the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Chevrolet Bolt and the Hyundai Kona – and found them to be more accurate. The Kona’s range meter generally underestimated the distance the car could travel, the tests showed. Recurrent conducted the study with the help of a National Science Foundation grant. Tesla, Case said, has consistently designed the range meters in its cars to deliver aggressive rather than conservative estimates: “That’s where Tesla has taken a different path from most other automakers.” Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, shown here in Beijing this year, gave the directive about a decade ago to write software for vehicles that gave drivers “rosy” estimates of driving range, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. REUTERS/Tingshu Wang Failed tests and false advertising Tesla isn’t the only automaker with cars that don’t regularly achieve their advertised ranges. One of the experts, Gregory Pannone, co-authored a study of 21 different brands of electric vehicles, published in April by SAE International, an engineering organization. The research found that, on average, the cars fell short of their advertised ranges by 12.5% in highway driving. The study did not name the brands tested, but Pannone told Reuters that three Tesla models posted the worst performance, falling short of their advertised ranges by an average of 26%. The EV pioneer pushes the limits of government testing regulations that govern the claims automakers put on window stickers, the three automotive experts told Reuters. Like their gas-powered counterparts, new electric vehicles are required by U.S. federal law to display a label with fuel-efficiency information. In the case of EVs, this is stated in miles-per-gallon equivalent (MPGe), allowing consumers to compare them to gasoline or diesel vehicles. The labels also include estimates of total range: how far an EV can travel on a full charge, in combined city and highway driving. “They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests.” EV makers have a choice in how to calculate a model’s range. They can use a standard EPA formula that converts fuel-economy results from city and highway driving tests to calculate a total range figure. Or automakers can conduct additional tests to come up with their own range estimate. The only reason to conduct more tests is to generate a more favorable estimate, said Pannone, a retired auto-industry veteran. Tesla conducts additional range tests on all of its models. By contrast, many other automakers, including Ford, Mercedes and Porsche, continue to rely on the EPA’s formula to calculate potential range, according to agency data for 2023 models. That generally produces more conservative estimates, Pannone said. Mercedes-Benz told Reuters it uses the EPA’s formula because it believes it provides a more accurate estimate. “We follow a certification strategy that reflects the real-world driving behavior of our customers in the best possible way,” the German carmaker said in a statement. Ford and Porsche didn’t respond to requests for comment. A screengrab from Tesla’s website advertising the Model S sport sedan. Driving range is among the most important factors considered by electric vehicle buyers. Whatever an automaker decides, the EPA must approve the window-sticker numbers. The agency told Reuters it conducts its own tests on 15% to 20% of new electric vehicles each year as part of an audit program and has tested six Tesla models since the 2020 model year. EPA data obtained by Reuters through the Freedom of Information Act showed that the audits resulted in Tesla being required to lower all the cars’ estimated ranges by an average of 3%. The projected range for one vehicle, the 2021 Model Y Long Range AWD (all-wheel drive), dropped by 5.15%. The EPA said all the changes to Tesla’s range estimates were made before the company used the figures on window stickers. The EPA said it has seen “everything” in its audits of EV manufacturers’ range testing, including low and high estimates from other automakers. “That is what we expect when we have new manufacturers and new technologies entering the market and why EPA prioritizes” auditing them, the agency said. The EPA cautioned that individuals’ actual experience with vehicle efficiency might differ from the estimates the agency approves. Independent automotive testers commonly examine the EPA-approved fuel-efficiency or driving range claims against their own experience in structured tests or real-world driving. Often, they get different results, as in the case of Tesla vehicles. Pannone called Tesla “the most aggressive” electric-vehicle manufacturer when it comes to range calculations. “I’m not suggesting they’re cheating,” Pannone said of Tesla. “What they’re doing, at least minimally, is leveraging the current procedures more than the other manufacturers.” Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director for the automotive website Edmunds.com, reached a similar conclusion to Pannone after an extensive examination of vehicles from Tesla and other major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Hyundai and Porsche.

Elon Musk says Tesla will unveil its robotaxi on Aug. 8; shares pop,"Tesla will reveal its robotaxi product on Aug. 8, CEO Elon Musk said in a social media post on X.

Musk has spoken about the robotaxi project for years, and it could represent a major new business for the carmaker as investors grow wary of the company during a period of slowing growth.

Tesla shares rose over 3% in extended trading after Musk’s tweet.

Musk shared the release date on Friday after Reuters reported that plans for Tesla’s highly anticipated low-cost car model had been scrapped. Musk accused Reuters of “lying.”

Tesla’s robotaxi project, according to Musk’s past remarks, would allow Tesla vehicles to use self-driving technology to autonomously pick up riders for fares. In 2019, Musk said that he expected to have over 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020. Author Walter Isaacson also mentioned the robotaxi project in his biography of Musk, published in 2022.

Currently, Tesla offers advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS,) including its Autopilot option, as well as a premium Full Self-Driving “FSD” option, which costs $199 per month for subscribers. However, Teslas currently cannot operate without human intervention.

There is significant competition in the market for taxi services that use self-driving cars.

Alphabet’s autonomous vehicle unit Waymo operates driverless ride-hailing services in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, and is now ramping up in Tesla’s home base of Austin, Texas.

GM’s Cruise service previously offered self-driving car services in San Francisco before being wound down under regulatory scrutiny after an accident. Since the incident, Cruise’s robotaxi fleet has been grounded, local and federal governments have launched their own investigations and Cruise leadership has been gutted.

Elon Musk tells Twitter staff he sold Tesla stock to save the social network," 

Twitter's new owner Elon Musk, who is also CEO of electric vehicle maker [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) and U.S. defense contractor SpaceX, told employees of the social media business on Thursday that he recently sold shares of Tesla to ""save Twitter.""

He made the remarks during an all-hands meeting that he hosted in part to motivate Twitter employees who remain after sweeping layoffs to work hard. Musk let go of about half of Twitter employees following his acquisition of the company for $44 billion, or $54.20 per share.

[As CNBC previously reported,](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/) to finance his portion of that take-private deal, last week Musk sold at least another $3.95 billion worth of [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) stock. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission published Tuesday, the batch of shares he just sold amounted to 19.5 million more shares of Tesla.

Earlier this year, he also sold over $8 billion worth of Tesla stock in April and roughly $7 billion worth in August.

Musk has [brought in employees from Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html), including dozens of Autopilot engineers, to help with code review and other work at Twitter along with friends, financial backers and deputies from other companies that he has co-founded.

 

Among other things, [Musk wants Twitter to generate half of its revenue from Twitter Blue subscribers](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/read-elon-musks-first-email-to-all-twitter-employees.html), and to become less reliant on advertising revenue.

"Tesla video promoting self driving was staged, engineer testifies","Jan 17 [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-video-promoting-self-driving-was-staged-engineer-testifies-2023-01-17/?utm_source=reddit.com) - ""A 2016 video that Tesla (TSLA.O) used to promote its self-driving technology was staged to show capabilities like stopping at a red light and accelerating at a green light that the system did not have, according to testimony by a senior engineer.

The video, which remains archived on Tesla’s website, was released in October 2016 and promoted on Twitter by Chief Executive Elon Musk as evidence that “Tesla drives itself.”

To create the video, the Tesla used 3D mapping on a predetermined route from a house in Menlo Park, California, to Tesla’s then-headquarters in Palo Alto, he said.

Drivers intervened to take control in test runs, he said. When trying to show the Model X could park itself with no driver, a test car crashed into a fence in Tesla’s parking lot, he said.

“The intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016. It was to portray what was possible to build into the system,” Tesla's lawyer said, according to a transcript of his testimony seen by Reuters.

When Tesla released the video, Musk tweeted, “Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot.”

Tesla faces lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny over its driver assistance systems.

The U.S. Department of Justice began a criminal investigation into Tesla’s claims that its electric vehicles can drive themselves in 2021, after a number of crashes, some of them fatal, involving Autopilot, Reuters has reported.

The New York Times reported in 2021 that Tesla engineers had created the 2016 video to promote Autopilot without disclosing that the route had been mapped in advance or that a car had crashed in trying to complete the shoot, citing anonymous sources.

When asked if the 2016 video showed the performance of the Tesla Autopilot system available in a production car at the time, Elluswamy said, ""It does not.""

Elluswamy was deposed in a lawsuit against Tesla over a 2018 crash in Mountain View, California, that killed Apple engineer Walter Huang. ""

Of course Elon is no longer chairman so doesnt have as much control as previously, however he does still have significant control of the company and bad PR for him often means bad PR for Tesla. The two are almost inextricably linked given his holdings.

Tesla stock has best day in over a decade on Musk's 2025 growth projection,"Tesla shares soared 22% to close at $260.48 on Thursday, the stock’s best day since 2013, following the company’s better-than-expected earnings report.

The company late Wednesday reported revenue of $25.18 billion, which came in just under analysts’ expectations of $25.37 billion, but was up 8% compared with a year earlier. Tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted, topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents.

“We expect this surprising earnings beat to power a strong positive reaction in Tesla shares Thursday, given the degree to which investors have become conditioned to earnings misses from the company,” analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note.

Tesla’s profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits, which the JPMorgan analysts noted were a “potentially unsustainable driver” of earnings and cash flow.

Automakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year, and if they can’t meet the target, they can buy credits from other companies. Tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles.

Tesla earnings also got a boost from FSD, the company’s Full Self-Driving Supervised system. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the earnings call that FSD contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after Tesla made it available for use in the Cybertruck and added a feature called “Actually Smart Summon.”

CEO Elon Musk said on the call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, citing “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15% for 2025.

Even bullish Deutsche Bank analysts doubted Musk’s forecast and wrote, in a note following the earnings report, “Our view remains more reserved at 10-15% (~2.03m),” and assumes Tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its Model Y at a price under $30,000 after subsidies, and other variants of the small SUV.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley who also recommend buying the stock, called Musk’s 2025 vehicle delivery growth prediction a “maybe.” They set their estimate at 14%.

It “clearly depends on the company’s ability to improve affordability through cheaper model (next gen) introduction, financing offers and improved features,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Thursday.

A grain of salt

Musk said on the Wednesday call that Tesla plans to start production of its recently unveiled Cybercab, a robotaxi with butterfly doors and no steering wheel or pedals, by the end of 2026. He also said Tesla would conduct driverless ridehailing in California and Texas next year in its existing cars, which are not currently safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time.

Bernstein analysts, who have a bearish price target of $120 on shares of Tesla, wrote in a note out Thursday: “The tone of Tesla’s conference call was ebullient and filled with Musk prognostications that have historically polarized bull and bear investors, and was more akin to a pep rally, with the company only taking two questions from sell-siders.”

Musk has for years promised shareholders a software upgrade that can turn Teslas into robotaxis. That hasn’t happened yet. Musk has also promised a refreshed version of the Tesla Roadster since 2017. The design of the vehicle is not yet complete. 

The Bernstein analysts wrote, “We continue to struggle to see Tesla overcoming the technological and regulatory hurdles needed to leapfrog current level 4 robotaxis, and believe fully unsupervised FSD could be years away.”

They pointed to Musk’s “long history of being overly optimistic about FSD” and said crowdsourced research that shows “Tesla continues to lag well behind competitors” on robotaxis.

The share rally Thursday was the sharpest since a 24% gain in May 2013. The jump erased Tesla’s loss for the year and left the stock up 3% in 2024, though it still trails the 22% gain for the Nasdaq.

Elon Musk Says Bill Gates Has ‘Multi-Billion Dollar’ Tesla Short Position,"*I think we all knew this a while ago, but it was just reported again today;*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Bill Gates has a short position against Tesla Inc. that would now need between $1.5 billion and $2 billion to close out, Elon Musk said Friday in a series of tweets.

Musk said the position was $500 million and grew after Tesla “went up a lot.”

When asked last year on CNBC whether he was short Tesla, Gates said, “I don’t talk about my investments.”

Musk was replying to tweets after the close of his Twitter poll asking who respondents trust less -- politicians or billionaires. More than 75% said they had less trust in politicians.

Buffett's company earned $255 billion in revenue and booked $73 billion in investment gains last year, fueling $81 billion in net income. Moreover, it held $137 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of March — enough to buy Tesla in its entirety at the time, as its market value had tumbled below $100 billion during the coronavirus crash.

Meanwhile, Tesla had about 48,000 full-time workers last year, less than an eighth of Berkshire's workforce. It also generated about $25 billion in sales — a tenth of Berkshire's revenue — and posted a $900 million net loss. Musk's company also had only $6.6 billion in net assets last year, less than 1/60th of Berkshire's $425 billion.

Ford CEO Jim Farley says Tesla price cuts could start an EV price war,"https://news.yahoo.com/ford-ceo-jim-farley-says-110356902.html

Ford CEO Jim Farley said Tesla's price cuts could spark an electric-vehicle price war and transform some into commodities.

At a charity event in Detroit reported on by Bloomberg, Farley said Tesla's attempts to increase sales were ""completely rational and should surprise no one.""

Elon Musk's company has slashed the price of its cars six times this year, making the EVs more affordable than they have been for years. The cheapest model, Tesla's entry-level Model 3 sedan, now costs less than $40,000.

In January, Ford followed Tesla in cutting EV prices, discounting its plug-in Mustang Mach-E range by between about 1% and 8.8%.

""Price wars are breaking out everywhere,"" Farley said. Who's going to blink for growth?""

Tesla's price cuts are aimed at undercutting rivals and boosting market share, but the strategy has cost the company.

On Wednesday, the automaker logged revenue of $23.33 billion, which was roughly in line with estimates, according to Refinitiv. But its profits took a hit as net income plummeted 24% year-on-year to $2.51 billion during the three months ending March 31.

Seth Goldstein, an equities strategist for Morningstar, told Insider Tesla's price cuts had left legacy automakers scrambling. He said Ford, which previously predicted its EV business would keep losing money until at least 2026, was faced with the ""potential of having to cut prices or hurt profits even more.""

""That makes for an interesting scenario in terms of how they respond,"" Goldstein said.

Farley said at the Detroit event that Ford would focus on areas where there was less competition, such as pickup trucks and vans, Reuters reported.

Tesla execs Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel depart as company announces layoffs,"Tesla executives Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel announced Monday they are leaving the electric vehicle maker and clean energy company. CEO Elon Musk thanked both departing execs on X, the social network he owns and runs as chief technology officer.

The news comes after Tesla said it is laying off more than 10% of its workforce.

Baglino had worked with Tesla since its early years, starting as a firmware and electrical engineer in 2006. He most recently reported directly to Musk as the company’s senior vice president for powertrain and energy engineering.

Patel joined Tesla in 2016 after working as a senior advisor to former President Barack Obama on climate and energy issues, among other policy matters.

Reuters recently reported that Tesla has set aside plans to make a more affordable new EV at Musk’s direction. The strategy shift includes a greater focus on developing a “robotaxi” and comes amid steep competition including from BYD and other Chinese automakers with more affordable electric cars.

Patel and Baglino had been deeply involved in battery and vehicle manufacturing, related policy, and turning Tesla into a multinational EV manufacturer. They were less involved in autonomous vehicle technology at Tesla. 

Baglino wrote in a post on X:

“I made the difficult decision to move on from Tesla after 18 years yesterday. I am so thankful to have worked with and learned from the countless incredibly talented people at Tesla over the years. I loved tackling nearly every problem we solved as a team and feel gratified to have contributed to the mission of accelerating the transition to sustainable energy, a mission that I am quite passionate about.”

Musk responded on the platform, “Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla. Few have contributed as much as you.”

As of Monday morning, Tesla had not yet updated the “leadership” information on its corporate webpage to reflect Baglino’s departure.

Patel wrote in a post on the social network, “The past 8 years at Tesla have been filled with every emotion — but the feeling I have today is utmost gratitude,” adding, “My immigrant parents worked their asses off and as a result I’m the luckiest dude. Lucky to have been a part of @BarackObama’s campaign/administration, and truly honored to have worked at @Tesla to positively changing multiple industries.”

Musk replied to Patel, saying, “Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla. Much appreciated.”

CEO Elon Musk thanked both departing execs on X, the social network he owns and runs as chief technology officer. The news comes after Tesla said it is laying off more than 10% of its workforce. Baglino had worked with Tesla since its early years, starting as a firmware and electrical engineer in 2006. He most recently reported directly to Musk as the company’s senior vice president for powertrain and energy engineering. Patel joined Tesla in 2016 after working as a senior advisor to former President Barack Obama on climate and energy issues, among other policy matters. Reuters recently reported that Tesla has set aside plans to make a more affordable new EV at Musk’s direction. The strategy shift includes a greater focus on developing a “robotaxi” and comes amid steep competition including from BYD and other Chinese automakers with more affordable electric cars. Patel and Baglino had been deeply involved in battery and vehicle manufacturing, related policy, and turning Tesla into a multinational EV manufacturer. They were less involved in autonomous vehicle technology at Tesla. Baglino wrote in a post on X: “I made the difficult decision to move on from Tesla after 18 years yesterday. I am so thankful to have worked with and learned from the countless incredibly talented people at Tesla over the years. I loved tackling nearly every problem we solved as a team and feel gratified to have contributed to the mission of accelerating the transition to sustainable energy, a mission that I am quite passionate about.” Musk responded on the platform, “Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla. Few have contributed as much as you.” As of Monday morning, Tesla had not yet updated the “leadership” information on its corporate webpage to reflect Baglino’s departure. Patel wrote in a post on the social network, “The past 8 years at Tesla have been filled with every emotion — but the feeling I have today is utmost gratitude,” adding, “My immigrant parents worked their asses off and as a result I’m the luckiest dude. Lucky to have been a part of ’s campaign/administration, and truly honored to have worked at to positively changing multiple industries.” Musk replied to Patel, saying, “Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla. Much appreciated.” The CEO also said, in a post on X on Monday, “About every 5 years, we need to reorganize and streamline the company for the next phase of growth.” Baglino and Patel were not immediately available for comment.

How does Tesla go up 7% after all the news about Elon Musk’s autopilot incident?,"I guess I need to add this: I do **not** own any stocks or shorts or puts or whatever related to Tesla, because the way that Tesla works in the market confuses me. I just want to learn. 

Everybody also thinks this is an attack on Tesla and Musk. It is **not**. I want to know if this is the way that the market works or not.

Why do I care? Because Tesla is relatively a gigantic company. Why did I ask about if the same would happen with Apple? Because Apple is also a relatively gigantic company. 

I thought you were allowed to ask about stocks on this sub. 

———

On Friday August 25th, [Elon Musk posted a video on X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1695247110030119054?s=46&t=0YLBKtmQe8-F_nJ00NQvxg), that now has 44 million views, of him driving a Tesla on autopilot. In the video he has to brake the car himself when it almost runs a red light (at around 19:45). It also received a decent amount of news coverage. 

This appears to have not affected the stock’s value at all and as of the closing today (August 29th) the stock is up over 7%

I’d expect such an incident to have negative effects on a company’s value, but this didn’t. 

Are these sorts of things usually just not big deals? 

If Apple were demonstrating their new iPhone’s amazing app that works perfectly and then it caused the phone to crash, would that negatively affect the value?

Or is it basically all just about the money that the company brings in?

—— 

Thanks to everybody who answered nicely. I’ve gotten some explanations that make sense including:

- Elon’s livestream video wasn’t of current autopilot software on Teslas, but rather a beta FSD which performed very well. 
- 44 million people probably didn’t actually see that moment where “human intervention” takes place. Plus the media blew it out of proportion. 
- Computer trading algorithms don’t care about these minute things. 
- This isn’t exclusive to Tesla. Similar things like this happening to other gigantic companies happen and they barely matter. 
- The market overall went up on the 29th and Tesla has a high beta.

TSLA: Get ready to cash out from the largest ongoing pump and dump in history,"Ok, so TSLA will be included in S&P 500 in Dec 21. Old news. Around $100B(almost 1/5th of its market cap) of TSLA would need to be purchased(some active funds may have already purchased) based on current stock price.

The only reason I have been holding TSLA after it split is the whole S&P 500 inclusion thingy. After that, I don't know what will even move this stock. They freakin surpassed Berkshire and could surpass Facebook(for a short time)!!!

Today they will announce whether to include TSLA in two sessions or in one session.

[This is what happened when Yahoo was included(which is comparable to TSLA's inclusion as they have had relatively comparable size in comparison to S&P 500's size). Although I believe TSLA will rise again after some time, unlike Yahoo.](https://imgur.com/a/1qj22eR)

After the trading sessions, expect a big dip. As a lot of speculators this year have bought into TSLA precisely to front-run the index investors.

Also, the trade date Dec. 18, coincides with a once-quarterly event known as quadruple witching, the Friday near the end of each calendar quarter on which options and futures on both indexes and stocks expire simultaneously. Volume is usually heavy on those days and would help boost liquidity on the day of Tesla’s inclusion, investors said. (this paragraph copied straight from wsj)

So, I guess don't be a fool(unless there are some tax implications, which I don't have); buy the rumour, sell the news. TSLA will completely tank after the inclusion.

Also, remember NIO etc kind of benefit from the TSLA hype, so be very careful you all about them.

I don't think if you don't have any immediate tax implications, there wouldn't be much value holding TSLA for the longer term as there are better long term plays. And when or if TSLA reaches $700 or higher(I know I am very bullish, but that's why I am still holding it) there would be almost no point in holding it any longer.

Some special points to remember:

* TSLA already jumped 40% after its inclusion news broke out and had been steadily climbing before it due to rumour that it will be included in the index and Softbank's trade earlier this year.
* TSLA can issue more shares, especially in this valuation. I mean why wouldn't they, lol.

Pricing everything as if they are the next AMZN (TSLA story),"One of the things that amazes me currently in this market is that, it feels like we are trying to justify every new coming hot tech/growth company as if they are the next AMZN in their field. I think one of the delusions people are having lately is that they look at what people projected for AMZN 5-10-15 years ago and compare that to what actually happened.

While it is true that AMZN exceeded any sort of expectation by a huge margin (and did this consistently, year over year) it feels to me that we are taking perhaps one of the most unique success stories ever and then extrapolate that to others, thinking that as if those sort of growth and expectations are in fact more common and easy to achieve than not, regardless of the industry the subject company is operating in.

I could discuss this for a number of stocks, I wanted to open discussion for TSLA. As we all know, TSLA stock went up almost 8 fold in the last year. Today, it is common occurrence in the market that analysts are justifying these price levels and state why TSLA is just more than a car company. This argument obviously has its own merits, but aren't we little ahead ourselves and already attribute *from today,* all those things that could potentially be achieved and bake it into the price?

If we went back in in time, we could probably say AMZN was more than just a book company, but could we really say that they would have almost monopolistic power in most of the areas they operated in? Could we really say back in 2008 that AMZN would emerge the market leader in something like for instance Cloud? Or, did these things happen and then we realized how great AMZN became, *after the fact.* It feels like this was much easier to do in hindsight. But what if AMZN is truly that one outlier, anomaly, in the history of stock markets in terms of sustained growth and market power?

Isn't this what we are trying to do with TSLA here? I do think Elon is one of the greatest minds of our time and can achieve far beyond any other has achieved so I am not comparing Bezos or any other with Elon here. But what I am trying to say is that, just thinking TSLA as a company, aren't we already saying today that they already have monopolistic power in EV cars, autonomous driving, solar-energy trade, underground tunnels, robotaxis, etc. - you name it, as if they are already there and waiting to be switched on? It's as if we have already attributed everything we could imagine could happen and already announced TSLA as the winner.

Now this is the theory side of things. **How about financial side of things?**

I don't want to approach this from a car sales point of view, but I will make certain comments.

But what if we applied AMZN's growth trajectory into TSLA, without focusing too much on car sales, and just see what growth and valuation that would lead us? If TSLA is just more than a car company, what other example could serve best in terms of growth, thinking from an array of products and technological advantage perspective?

So I did a quick and dirty DCF calculation. In there, my starting point is the first year when AMZN hit $24 billion in revenue, which is 2009. TSLA achieved it's $24 billion in 2019, so from there onwards I am applying AMZN's growth trajectory for the following 10-11 years. Then, growth is gradually reduced in going into the terminal year. What this means is TSLA will be roughly $900 billion revenue generating company by year 20 (2040). From a car sales perspective, I can't really project how many cars it could sell in 20 years, but lets say it is 10 million cars. (I think GS said 15 million). Toyota in 2019 sold around this number I believe so with all the competition that will happen in this space, I think this is by no means and under-estimation. In 2019, TSLA sold roughly 367,500 cars and for a total revenue of $19.2 billion (excluding regulatory credits). On average this equates to $52k per car. In 20 years, car prices will be higher than what they are today obviously, but there will be competition and economies of scale to bring the price down. This one is hard to assume but let's say it grows 1.0% - 1.5% per year with long term inflation, again not necessarily higher because of these offsetting factors. If they do indeed sell 10+ million cars, this is roughly $600-650 billion from cars.

This leaves you with another $200-250 billion or so for other things, whatever you want to attribute this for - AI, robotaxies, insurance, and so on. Now this figure is a future value, so from today's perspective (using a discount rate of 8% used in my DCF below) that's roughly $60 billion (revenue). This is again a huge number, as it is almost another Facebook, 2x Coca-Cola etc., or half of GM/Toyota type business from revenue generating capability, again, from *today's perspective - none of which has already happened.*

Once again I want to point out that my revenue projections are not driven by bottoms-up car sales, rather, I am using simply AMZN trajectory in terms of growth, then try to attribute the resulting final revenue figure into parts, obviously majority being from car sales, and the rest from whatever you can think of. (Simply because we don't know what AI/Robos/Insurance/Transportation businesses can generate from revenue/profitability/market share perspective and more importantly what the competition in those areas can be). If you think TSLA can grow even more than AMZN, then I just want to remind you that you won't easily justify 40-50% revenue growth rates once you're in the 50+ billion zone, which is the point of the argument. AMZN, still achieved those growth rates when it had 100+ or 200+ billion, which is what we are already assuming here.

So in the stock price we have baked in, from a revenue perspective, a car business that will sell at least 10+ million cars (this number can obviously be higher but even 10 million will be big market share),  and other businesses that are worth, today, more than most companies you can think of.

Now this is the growth side of things. How about margins?

We know TSLA generated a last twelve months EBITDA margin of 14% as of Q3 2020. While margins from car manufacturing is certainly improving, most of this margin is actually attributed to sales of regulatory credits, which are by definition almost 100% profit. And so in reality, the margins are much lower, maybe around low single digits between 1-5%. Now this is important because even with all this revenue growth (and if you disagree with me and think it will even be higher), you still need to achieve big margins on your business. I mean really really good margins, we are talking about 15-25% each year. Interestingly, AMZN, while growing its top line crazily over the years and becoming a behemoth as it is today, always lacked in terms of their margins. That goes without saying they are a tech company that typically exhibit great returns on capital. So the point is they had to sacrifice their margins to be able to achieve this growth and this is an important point.

In my DCF, I am extremely generous. I kept TSLA's EBITDA margins at 15% for the next 3 years, bumped to 17.5%, 20.0%, then to finally 25.0% every 3 years in going forward. Once again these regulatory credits will not be there forever so those margins are extremely optimistic at this point. They might indeed achieve 25% margins in 10 years or so but it won't be this smooth.

With these two major factors, other items in the DCF are not super important. The discount rate is 8.0%, which I believe is reasonable, NWC and Capex assumptions are in line with what they are today and I don't think they would necessarily go down (if not go up). I just want to mention that you may completely disagree with some of the assumptions I outlined above. The point however is no matter what sort of DCF you come up with, you will end up either with lower or slight higher value for TSLA, using very, very aggressive assumptions for 10+ years. So the point and question is around the **margin of safety** here.

It seems I can't directly post pictures so here is the link for the DCF:

[https://ibb.co/mSHDcBh](https://ibb.co/mSHDcBh)

You might wonder, well your price is even higher than what it is today so why did you write this.

Once again my whole point in the argument was that the margin of error in TSLA's stock price right now is non-existent, because we've already treated it the next AMZN, gave the best margins possible, attributed big bucks on its other stuff. I think my DCF is still in the unreasonable side, but I wanted to point this out that even a s*light change in trajectory would mean a totally different path and stock price for TSLA.*

So the question is, are we ahead of ourselves with TSLA? This could also apply to others as well, this so called growth companies. It is as if we are pricing everything today and think that they have already achieved incredible market share in everything they touched and it's only a matter of time that these revenue/profits are realized. Are we taking one anomaly and applying this rationale for every other great company under the name of ""it's tech""? Elon is great and TSLA will be great. But the business model may not just allow them to be the next AMZN, regardless of technology or improvement.

One final comment I will make is related to autonomous driving and data TSLA is collecting. While it is for certain that this data gives TSLA an incredible power in developing this technology, I see couple of issues with this as it relates to future of this thing.

Companies such as Facebook are big not because of their software, but because of the network effects they exhibit. And because of those network effects they become larger and larger and are able to collect more data, which creates an incredibly profitable cycle for them as they can monetize that data right away. Data for TSLA here only matters in developing that technology. Monetization however, is another story.

What I am not entirely sure with all this AI story is that if it needs to continuously get updated for use, then how do regulators/companies determine the older version was safe to use to begin with. What I understand is that AI is something that needs to get constantly updated based on data, challenge here is that you are carrying people's lives here (as opposed to targeting ads) so there needs to be an infliction point where the full autonomous driving AI software should be at a point where it is certainly 100% safe to use. Because if it is not, then the technology fails until it reaches to that point. If it does reach out to that point, then how difficult is it going to be for others to get to that point or use similar technology if what you need is to get from point A to B safely.

Besides there is the price factor in as well. Let's say TSLA is the only one who can do this. If autonomous driving is too expensive, then how much will people pay for it? Say if the car is 50k and you have to pay extra 50k on top of that - would you do this? Would this have a cannibalization effect? Or if it is monthly subscription fees, would you go on to pay this forever? How significant will the cost be in 20 years from now when others presumably also start providing some sort of service.

On the other hand, if it is not expensive and only a fraction of the car price, then how are you going to achieve these growth levels with that data and technology to begin with. It is one thing to have a great technology, another to monetize it. They might license it for sure, but then you lose all that power right away. So the question then becomes, will it be a niche product or commodity at the end of the day - either of which will not allow you to have incredible returns.

What are your thoughts?",investing,TSLA,"Pricing everything as if they are the next AMZN (TSLA story) One of the things that amazes me currently in this market is that, it feels like we are trying to justify every new coming hot tech/growth company as if they are the next AMZN in their field. I think one of the delusions people are having lately is that they look at what people projected for AMZN 5-10-15 years ago and compare that to what actually happened. While it is true that AMZN exceeded any sort of expectation by a huge margin (and did this consistently, year over year) it feels to me that we are taking perhaps one of the most unique success stories ever and then extrapolate that to others, thinking that as if those sort of growth and expectations are in fact more common and easy to achieve than not, regardless of the industry the subject company is operating in. I could discuss this for a number of stocks, I wanted to open discussion for TSLA. As we all know, TSLA stock went up almost 8 fold in the last year. Today, it is common occurrence in the market that analysts are justifying these price levels and state why TSLA is just more than a car company. This argument obviously has its own merits, but aren't we little ahead ourselves and already attribute *from today,* all those things that could potentially be achieved and bake it into the price? If we went back in in time, we could probably say AMZN was more than just a book company, but could we really say that they would have almost monopolistic power in most of the areas they operated in? Could we really say back in 2008 that AMZN would emerge the market leader in something like for instance Cloud? Or, did these things happen and then we realized how great AMZN became, *after the fact.* It feels like this was much easier to do in hindsight. But what if AMZN is truly that one outlier, anomaly, in the history of stock markets in terms of sustained growth and market power? Isn't this what we are trying to do with TSLA here? I do think Elon is one of the greatest minds of our time and can achieve far beyond any other has achieved so I am not comparing Bezos or any other with Elon here. But what I am trying to say is that, just thinking TSLA as a company, aren't we already saying today that they already have monopolistic power in EV cars, autonomous driving, solar-energy trade, underground tunnels, robotaxis, etc. - you name it, as if they are already there and waiting to be switched on? It's as if we have already attributed everything we could imagine could happen and already announced TSLA as the winner. Now this is the theory side of things. **How about financial side of things?** I don't want to approach this from a car sales point of view, but I will make certain comments. But what if we applied AMZN's growth trajectory into TSLA, without focusing too much on car sales, and just see what growth and valuation that would lead us? If TSLA is just more than a car company, what other example could serve best in terms of growth, thinking from an array of products and technological advantage perspective? So I did a quick and dirty DCF calculation. In there, my starting point is the first year when AMZN hit $24 billion in revenue, which is 2009. TSLA achieved it's $24 billion in 2019, so from there onwards I am applying AMZN's growth trajectory for the following 10-11 years. Then, growth is gradually reduced in going into the terminal year. What this means is TSLA will be roughly $900 billion revenue generating company by year 20 (2040). From a car sales perspective, I can't really project how many cars it could sell in 20 years, but lets say it is 10 million cars. (I think GS said 15 million). Toyota in 2019 sold around this number I believe so with all the competition that will happen in this space, I think this is by no means and under-estimation. In 2019, TSLA sold roughly 367,500 cars and for a total revenue of $19.2 billion (excluding regulatory credits). On average this equates to $52k per car. In 20 years, car prices will be higher than what they are today obviously, but there will be competition and economies of scale to bring the price down. This one is hard to assume but let's say it grows 1.0% - 1.5% per year with long term inflation, again not necessarily higher because of these offsetting factors. If they do indeed sell 10+ million cars, this is roughly $600-650 billion from cars. This leaves you with another $200-250 billion or so for other things, whatever you want to attribute this for - AI, robotaxies, insurance, and so on. Now this figure is a future value, so from today's perspective (using a discount rate of 8% used in my DCF below) that's roughly $60 billion (revenue). This is again a huge number, as it is almost another Facebook, 2x Coca-Cola etc., or half of GM/Toyota type business from revenue generating capability, again, from *today's perspective - none of which has already happened.* Once again I want to point out that my revenue projections are not driven by bottoms-up car sales, rather, I am using simply AMZN trajectory in terms of growth, then try to attribute the resulting final revenue figure into parts, obviously majority being from car sales, and the rest from whatever you can think of.

I experimented with committing to a $25 dollar per week investment in TSLA for at least a year and here are my results.,"Last year I challenged myself to invest at least $25 automatically in Tesla each week using a recurring transfer. I figured it would be a good way to build up my investment in the company while taking a manageable risk and potentially getting some market gains. Since my brokerage offered partial share investments I figured it would be a fun way to see where my money was in a year.

After 1 year here are my results:

Start Date: July 6, 2020

Initial investment: $30 (.023017 shares at 1,300.38 edit: after 5:1 split ~$260)

July 6 2021 Investment Value: $2,546.70

Total Invested with Auto-Transfer: $1,300

Total Return: $697 (+37.64%)

Extra periodic market buys: ~$550

Average Cost of entire stake: $447.40

Current price of Stock: 657.54 (about 150% gain since initial investment date)

Conclusion: Although it would have been great to be able to increase my investment on each dip, having the recurring transfer helped me take advantage of the partial share feature offered by my brokerage and keep my average cost low. During the same time period SPY gained about 36% edit: however, the only way to have gained 36% would have been to have had the $1300 I invested back last July. Otherwise, with the same auto transfer method the gains would have been 17% in SPY. Still a good return but 19% lower than the higher risk TSLA investment(math below in another edit). Although it would have been nice to be able put $1300 back in July 2020 and see it more than double, because I didn't have cash on hand, I only got about 1/3 of the potential gains of holding the stock the entire time. This gamble netted more than having the money in spy, but I guess that’s the risk premium. I am happy with the results of my little experiment and plan to continue this process and add a few more dollars per week into other companies and ETF's that I feel strongly about.

Let me know your thoughts. I know this isn't groundbreaking stuff, but it's a small look into what you can do if you are literally storing the equivalent of 3 lunch meals a week in an investment account. Obviously one side note, the biggest downside to this way of investing is that my tax lots are all over the place and if I have to sell, I have an ongoing 1 year rolling date for ""long"" tax rates but, I don't plan on selling any time soon, so as time goes on, that will be less of an issue.

Edit: Forgot to add a little more context: I currently have $150 a month going into a Traditional IRA, 9% of my income going into a 457 (~350 per check 2x a month) and a bunch that goes into my public servant pension. In addition to that, I regularly put ~200-300 into various stocks and ETF's that I hold each month. Although this investment represents a small amount of what I invest and save, it was probably the most exciting thing to watch all year.

Edit 2: this was posted as a comment but here it is here too. 

A number of people point out that the price of the s&p has gone up YOY an amount equivalent to what I earned on this investment. Now a couple disclaimers: I don’t believe that this is a viable investment option for someone to do with their whole check. But here is an apples to apples comparison (excluding dividend which wouldn’t only affect it a few bucks since we are dealing with such a small amount.) But, here is the apples to apples comparison. This is using the weekly open price on yahoo finance for a year investing $25 per week. Again not trying to say this a better investment than spy, I don’t think it is but this is apples to apples.

"Ford’s MachE – a examination of Tesla’s competition, with $TSLA implications","
TL/DR upfront:

Upcoming EV competition is *the* driving DD behind the Tesla bear narrative: that EV competition will show up à market competition will drive EV prices (and therefore $TSLA margins) down to industry-norms. I think this reasoning is flawed. Ford’s unprofitability with the MachE provides a window into what the competition is facing, and why Tesla is *very likely* to retain supply capped demand and see robust gross margin growth--insulated from the effects of market competition—for several years (until \~ 2026-2028). 

\---- 

Argument:

**Fords issues with EV profitabili**ty (link:  [Ford CFO says inflation has erased Mustang Mach-E profits, but isn't hurting demand (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/ford-cfo-says-inflation-has-erased-mustang-mach-e-profits-but-isnt-hurting-demand.html) ) i**s a** **PROXY** **for legacy auto’s outlook writ large.** 

Ford’s ‘Tesla Killer’ is their Mach E, which is a BEV (full battery) crossover SUV. However, recently Ford announced that they get zero profit from sales of their Mach E. Price information is below. 

* The ‘Standard Range’ RWD (68kwh battery, 230 miles EPA range, the lowest $ base model) is $42,895 before dealer markups and delivery fees
* The ‘Extended Range’ (88kwh, 300 miles EPA, the lowest $ long range model) is $52,000 before dealer/delivery

Fords lack of Mach-E profitability is VERY interesting because the car is highly priced while also benefiting from several cost-lowering factors:

* $7,500 U.S. federal EV subsidy (Ford has yet to hit the 200,000 vehicle cap for the $7500, at which point it gradually decreases). Tesla buyers do not qualify for any EV tax credits right now. 
* Made in Mexico with cheaper, non-unionized labor 
* Usage of large pouch-style batteries, which are cheaper but lower-quality
* A more battery-efficient Car form-factor (as compared to a truck), meaning less batteries for a desired range and, therefore, lower cost of production. 

If Ford is unprofitable with a high-priced EV benefiting from $7,500, made in Mexico with lower priced components, how are they going to be profitable with the F150 Lightning? The F150 lightning will,

* Be made by Union labor at U.S. labor prices 
* Have a less-efficient form factor (truck aerodynamics are very bad)
* Have higher User battery needs (towing range). 
   * F150 lightning loses 50% of its range when towing a 23-foot airstream trailer. Add to this cold-weather battery reductions, heating needs, going up inclines…the trucks 230 mile range’s real drivable radius when towing can get extremely limited very quickly. 
* See a gradually reduced subsidy amount ($7,500 --> $3750 --> $1875) 

It is very possible that the F150 Lightning begins to see razor-thin profit margins (or none at all) over the near future. 

Additionally, Ford has additional issues it has to tackle:

* Growing percentages of EV sales will reduce dealership income (most of which is derived from maintenance and repair), leading to more pervasive markups
* A need to develop a ‘supercharging’ network. 
   * Look more deeply into their published numbers—if you nix Tesla’s superchargers (which they can access rn), as Tesla will jack up prices for non-Tesla’s over time (especially when the supercharger network begins to get overburdened), and eliminate low-power chargers, look closely in your area at the ACTUAL NUMBER of high power charging stations individually. There may be chargepoint nodes in your area, but at least in Atlanta, the total stalls are very low. 
* Battery supply shortages --> higher prices for batteries
   * This is why Fords CEO has been talking about the need for federal support with battery raw material production 

**SO WHAT?**

1.  Ford has to raise prices—they have no other choice. 
   1. None of the sub-bullets above (dealership cut, need for expanded charger network, declining subsidy $, higher priced U.S. labor, higher priced batteries with less-efficient form factors) is easily solvable. While Ford talks about separating EVs from its dealership network, that legal fight will take YEARS.  
2. This same situation will manifest in other legacy automakers 
3. Legacy auto debt levels (looking at Ford and VW, in particular) mean they can’t afford to produce less cars or see zero profit.
4. Therefore, legacy auto has significant pressure to maintain high prices
5. Tesla is, therefore, insulated from the price reduction and gross margin contracting effects of market competition. 

Add to this several Tesla-phenomena 

1. Tesla’s cost of production will continue to decline, meaning that gross margins will continue to expand 
   1. Technology reasons: dime-casting, structural battery, and 4680 (if it continues to scale) batteries 
   2. Economies of scale reasons: Tesla is centralizing serious production capacity in its main four factories. 50% CAGR can be achieved for several years with the current factory footprint alone. Austin is projected to eventually produce 2 million units alone, per year. I would doubt these projections if it wasn’t for Tesla’s record setting CAGR—which has surprised the entire industry over the past three years. 
2. Therefore, because Tesla has more ‘buffer’ to decrease prices—in an environment that is continuing to improve and in the context that legacy auto faces), Tesla has the ability to win any price war for several years into the future 

Conclusion

Tesla will be able to maintain supply capped demand for its cars and will have minimal pressure on gross margins from market competition for several years into the future. While some legacy auto (VW) MIGHT produce EVs in large numbers, this will not negatively impact Tesla gross margins. 

Would **love** for folks to put forward a strong counter argument. I have several $TSLA 2024 leaps and, if I am wrong in my assumptions here, would muuuuuch rather know that my thinking is faulty than continue to sit on this volatile position.

edit @ 622pm est. A few of you have pointed out that I am assuming tesla costs of production go down, but don't say the same for legacy. What I am trying to say here is that legacy production cost decreases HAVE to go down just to maintain current profitability levels as they lose the $7500 subsidy, begin making cars with UNIONized American labor, with (for the F150 L) less efficient form factors. No, I don't have the numbers for this because I'm not omnipotent--but consider: these are serious headwinds. 7500 is a HUGE subsidy on a 43,000 dollar car.

The recent TSLA price spike was timed too perfectly,"(This is from my personal investing notes. I wanted to put it out there and see if anyone feels the same. Hopefully others are willing to contribute knowledge and observations about this very anomalous event)

I realize that this journal entry got a bit lengthy, so I chopped it into three parts, plus a very hand-wavy speculative conclusion part.

----     
The Pump  
-----     

Mid-January 2020, articles begin pumping TSLA as Musk announces share purchases.    
    
_Markets Insider -  Tesla short sellers have lost nearly $12 billion in just 7 weeks_     
     
_Markets Insider - Tesla has yet another biggest bull on Wall Street. Here's why he thinks the stock could surge 57%._    
     
_Electrek - Tesla (TSLA) gets new $800 price target based on its ability to execute_        
     
Musk is no stranger to stock pumping. Last year he advertised a private share price of 420$, ""funding secured"", to draw in investors. It is not surprising that this time the company (or another party) has turned to media outlets to get article placement from a third party. It is frowned-upon, but not uncommon, for companies to pay journalists, through brokers, to place articles in major publications.   

At the same time, mid-January, coordinated social media and message board posts appeared hyping TSLA and urging users to buy stock. Social media posts appeared on reddit, twitter, facebook about the price of Tesla on trajectory for $1000/share. Many influential users were caught in the frenzy and spread the word. A reddit and twitter user named /u/WSBgod began buying calls in TSLA at $600+; posting his positions and urging his large follower base to do the same. Many of these social media posts were well-written, edgy and bear the hallmarks of professional  copywriters.    

----    
The Dump    
----   
Tesla price began to rise. Viral social media posts and positive articles created high demand for TSLA stock, driving retail investors into a frenzy. On some message boards, users were seen urging people to take credit card advances or student loans to buy Tesla stock at $600+.   

At this point, a short-term ""spike"" in Teslas price occured. For the purposes of discussion, we will consider $767 (the stock issue price, discussed below) at market close to be the defining price of the spike.   

This spike began on 02/03 and ended on 02/26. The stock market was open 18 days  during this window. More remarkably, the closing price of TSLA was only above $767 per share on *12 days* during the window.   
**Chart of the 767$ price line and the recent spike**:   
https://gfycat.com/quaintslimyeuropeanpolecat   

It turns out this short stock market spike was no surprise to Tesla. Tesla and Goldman Sachs were already preparing to issue stock during this narrow period. Tesla filed an 8-K on 02/19 to issue  2.65 million new shares at $767 per share. Teslas/Goldman's  ""luck"" allowed them to issue on one of the top ten highest dates in TSLA history.    

Social media and message board influencers sold dreams of $1500 ""moon"" prices to middle-class retail investors. Many of his new investors were young; drawn by the new mobile-based, zero-commision brokers such as Robinhood. These younger investors typically turn to social media for their stock research. 

Many new and inexperienced investors are unfamiliar with stock ""dilution"" (the concept that issuing new stock devalues existing shareholders). Some shareholders even took to message boards to praise Tesla/Goldman for issuing more shares. Tesla raked in $2.31 billion of that cash advance, student loan, and summer job money during this short period of time, by issuing new shares at the $767 price.    

While the stock issue was happening, insiders began exercising options and dumping their stock. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with insiders selling stock. However  they were *very lucky* that this period happened mid-February - directly in-between earnings calls. This is one of the few timeframes outside of their blackout dates (blackout dates tend to cover most dates in the year for executives, particularly around earnings).

Five insiders can be seen exercising (buying) options and dumping stock during the narrow 18-day February spike time frame. Amidst the insider sales there is only one insider purchase - a well-publicized stock purchase by Elon Musk himself.     

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TSLA/insider-trades/    

----     
The wreckage settles     
----     

After the dump finished, the retail investor money was safely in the hands of insiders and Teslas cash reserves. Nameless large traders (known as ""whales"") began dumping the shares in high-volume batches, reaping the final harvest of the inflated stock price. Coincidentally, Covid-19 caused a general decrease in stock prices on the NYSE. The stock price plummeted. TSLA is now hovering around ~$400/share on 03/18, less than half the price of the all-time high where retail investors were paying upwards of $800-900 per share.    

Tesla is now $2.31 billion richer (although Tesla's high cash burn rate will incinerate this money within two quarters). Insiders at Tesla have gained hundreds of millions from their timely exit.    

On twitter and message boards, many users are depressed and downtrodden. The investment they purchased during the flurry of hype has lost its value. Many of the users who bought TSLA now joke about suicide or selling their house. Many users who got caught in the Tesla hype are silent - ashamed of their losses. Many are selling their devalued shares at a huge loss and will not return to invest in stocks for the time being.      

-----   
The other kind of speculation   
----    
Stock frenzys are not a new phenomenon. We can blame the media for the unrealistic moonshot expectations towards TSLA during the hype period.     
    
Yet, it is tough not to look at the timing of the entire event and squint:    
* The company orchestrated one of its largest stock issues during a very narrow 12 day market peak window -  a masterstroke in perfect timing and preparation     
* The media blitz ""pump"" occurred despite Teslas high debt load and extremely low car production rate (400k/year).     
* Institutional investors stayed put and let retail investors run in to the slaughter, chasing promises of $1000+ TSLA    
* Tesla insiders dumped their stock during this period       
    
Sadly, the SEC has been in a deep slumber for the past two decades. With the tech industry oligopolies running amok; plus thousands of pump-and-dumps that could only be orchestrated in a now socially-interconnected world, we need their enforcement now more than ever.     
    
Maybe there is some mythical horn we have to blow to rouse the SEC from its slumber. Until then, we can only look at incidents like this and squint at the happenstance. I hope that people far smarter and better researched than myself will look into the Tesla spike and verify that everything is above-board.    
     
""Funding secured""

Edit: Counterpoints
-----

There are a few aspects of this situation that go against my hypothesis that the price was pumped.

* The dump occurred during the Covid-19 outbreak. It is difficult to seperate market manipulation from the general downturn during this period   
* Tesla insiders still hold a large portion of TSLA stock   
* Musk himself purchased stock during the spike. (This is a good point, although I don't believe the stock purchase represents a major buy, considering Musk's enormous wealth. Teslas survival is a point of personal pride to Musk. He has been known to play dirty when his reputation is threatened - he once hired a private investigator to dig up dirt on a dive instructor from Thailand that snubbed him)

$TSLA - summary of analyst thoughts following Battery Day,"**BULLS:**

**Oppenheimer: ""Doing More With Less.** TSLA outlined a robust reimagining of battery design, manufacturing, and performance including targeting a $25K vehicle in three years and 20x capacity increase by 2030. It is ramping a pilot line featuring a comprehensive redesign of product architecture, basic materials, and process technology and expects to yield \~56% cost declines, 54% range improvement, and 69% capex reduction, with initial benefits seen over 12–18 months, achieviing run-rate at \~three years. TSLA reiterated 30–40% delivery growth in 2020 (implied 478–515K) ahead of consensus estimates. We are impressed with the ambition of the endeavor and believe this roadmap charts ongoing technology and cost leadership for TSLA enabling sales into the entire LDV market.

We expect the ability and timing for Tesla to fully achieve these targets to be one investor debate post the event, as Tesla has not always met its past targets.

"Why Cathie Wood might be right, and why TSLA is actually STILL fairly or even undervalued at these levels.","""Analysts have been calling the stock “overvalued” since the day they went public, because they all keep comparing it to other car companies. I wish I had a dollar for every analyst who pointed out how “*every other car company sells ten times as many cars*”. 

 I’ve also repeatedly bumped into some lazy analysis that Tesla is expensive because its current P/E is 1,270x or forward P/E is 204x. However, I’ve hardly ever seen a Tesla bear put out a detailed valuation in support of their bearish thesis which makes me wonder if a lot of people are simply dismissing Tesla in arrogance.

But the thing is, they’re all making the same mistake:

**Tesla isn’t a car company.**

They’re an energy and technology and SaaS company that makes cars.

Once you realize what Tesla really is, you start to see what their place in the market is going to be in the years to come.

They acquired Grohmann Engineering. They acquired Perbox. They acquired Maxwell Technologies and Hibar Systems. And of course everyone remembers the Solar City acquisition back before dropping Motors from their name. They didn’t acquire these companies because they thought they were cool. They did it so nobody else could.

* There are 25,000 EV charging stations in the United States. 20,000 of them are owned by Tesla.
* Tesla is currently the #1 li-ion battery manufacturer in America, and #5 in the world.
* Tesla has secured the rights to large supplies of lithium, and has developed their own internal process for extracting lithium deposits inexpensively from other sources.

These segments of the energy space — battery production and EV charging — are a market sector that’s going to grow 50 fold in the next 15 years as consumer demand for EV’s increases. All of the major auto manufacturers have declared they’re shifting towards electric cars.

Where are they going to get the batteries? How are their customers going to charge them?

The answer: Tesla.

Musk has made it clear from the beginning that their intent is to supply batteries for the entire EV *industry*, not just their own cars, and has also more or less come out and said that he’s open to letting other auto manufacturers access their Supercharger network. That puts them squarely in the energy business as the single most capable distributor.

There’s also been chatter about licensing their self-driving technology, and using their self-driving technology as a recurring revenue generation, which would be a very attractive value-add for the other OEM’s. And all of these things don’t even begin to cover the expected growth in residential energy with products like rooftop solar, Powerwall, etc.""

To: Everybody

As of yesterday, we had over 50,000 net new orders for this quarter. Based on current trends, we have a good chance of exceeding the record 90,700 deliveries of Q4 last year and making this the highest deliveries/sales quarter in Tesla history!

In order to achieve this, we need sustained output of 1,000 Model 3’s per day. Almost all parts of the Model 3 production system have exceeded 1000 units on multiple days (congratulations!!) and we’ve averaged about 900/day this week, so we’re only about 10% away from 7000/week.

Is Musk getting the Shorts to pay for TSLA going private?,"I think we may be about to witness the greatest financial judo move in recorded history: **Musk will make Tesla private and bury the Shorts, using their own money**. It will not cost him a dime. Detailed explanation below:

Why is this even conceivable? Because Tesla is the most shorted stock ever. There are more shorts to cover than shareholders who would prefer to cash-out at $420.

[Some TSLA data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/tsla/key-statistics/):

* Shares outstanding: 171M 
* Float: 127M shares, of which:
 * Musk: [34M shares](https://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/insiders/musk-elon-831665)
 * Institutionals: 81M shares.

     Almost all of them (above 70M shares) are not prohibited from holding shares in a private company.
 * Other (incl retail investors): 12M shares.


      Note there aren't enough of those to significantly change the picture.

* Short interest: [35M shares](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/tsla/short-interest)

Now let's *assume*: 

* This is real. Elon actually has someone willing to buy out any shareholder who doesn't want to, or cannot, go private, at $420.
* Most institutional investors will chose to remain with the privatized Tesla and not exit at $420.
* The board approves, and it goes to a shareholder vote, with a guaranteed 2/3rd majority of Musk and almost all the top institutionals.

What will happen? 

* You have 35M shorts to cover. Less than 35M shares to do that. Nobody will sell for less than the 420 they know they'll get anyway. Result: [Volkswagen-style short squeeze](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen/short-sellers-make-vw-the-worlds-priciest-firm-idUSTRE49R3I920081028).
* Anybody who wants out can sell during the short squeeze. 
* If the squeeze goes high enough, some shareholders may change their mind and sell anyway. Probably all the shorts will be covered, but significantly north of 420.
* The only shareholders remaining after the squeeze are those who want to take their stocks into the private stage.

Result: There are no shareholders left that need to be bought out at $420. The short squeeze took care of those. Tesla goes private. Cost to Musk: ZERO.

A classic judo move - use your opponent's momentum against them.

I realize the above scenario sounds insane. But the logic is sound. Even if more institutionals want out, the short squeeze will take care of most of them, and the actual cost of privatization will be a small fraction of TSLA's valuation.

Warren Buffett's although we love him, he's one of the top 7 wisest who ever lived and has the motto ""invest in things you understand"" (it should be added that there should at least be ample time to get to understand it coz' most are very much understandable or it's just pride to stick to simple to manufacturer but en masse consumables and the like as I call his favorites, assets like gum, candy, airlines and softdrinks which are everywhere and all customers are repeat customers) but there's still that constant, that he's not infallible. What it means to 'understand' has to be truly be analyzed way deeply than ever before.

As most have said in the tech industry, sir Warren's fundamental which includes that it's highly speculative (also it's not on the record but it implies he's not into Elon Musk's kind of personality which for him is unpredictable but that's another miss in the fundamental analysis of the one who leads Tesla) analysis of Tesla appears not to be fundamental at all coz' it's most likely incomplete. As most have said Tesla is not just a car company, it's not just a products company selling cars. What was once speculative and beyond the norm have materialized, an example is EV cars that are practical compared to EVs from generations past, now you have the many Models of Tesla. Elon Musk w/ Tesla has proof that they can execute what seems to be many as speculative (although I don't agree with him 100%, especially when it comes to 100% autonomy, coz' technology is buy a tool for mankind and will always babysit any technology).

Tesla is not just a car company, it's more than that- its an energy company (generating revenues energy services like charging and at the same time it ""ate it's own cake too"" as they say, it creates the products, the batteries to facilities that energy charging service), it's an A.I. company, solar energy company and a robotics company which is still at a speculation stage wether people will buy that but given Tesla w/ Elon's leadership, there's a high probability that Optimus will be practically used almost everywhere (just like again, EV as practical long range modes of transportation was a pipe dream until they launched en masse the Model S and the Models after that).

granted he loves CEOs and founders who have a laid back personality that are orthodox but orthodox in the big way, like Tim Cook, and granted TSLA is overbought by saying TSLA has the market cap of the auto industry combined vs. it's book value (math part of things, ruled by figures/number so it's more a part of technical analysis still), is he avoiding TSLA because:

a)  Elon Musk's personality is the biggest Think Big of all Think Bigs in the industrial history (way bigger than Henry Ford or Vanderbilt and the others who built industrial america which spilled to the world) and he's not comfortable with that

b) or is it because it's personal coz' they had a little war on words in the interviews and on X/formerly Twitter?

If it's about a) then it contradicts with his being on the Left mindset (a democrat, I'm with team common sense by the way at the moment coz' it has clarity, consistency and specific solutions) coz' the Left is very unorthodoxed and sometimes even comically non-sensical, going way beyond common sense.

JPMorgan advises clients to expose 1% of their portfolio to Bitcoin,"In a recent note to clients, strategists from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) suggested a one percent portfolio allocation to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

As reported by Bloomberg, JPM strategists Joyce Chang and Amy Ho opined that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against fluctuations from traditional assets like bonds, stocks, and commodities. However, they advised clients to allocate a small percentage due to the risk of major downturns in Bitcoin’s value.

After setting a new all-time high above $58,000, the value of the digital asset slumped to less than $45,000 and has been struggling to recover ever since.

Chang and Ho told investors:

>*In a multi-asset portfolio, investors can likely add up to 1% of their allocation to cryptocurrencies in order to achieve any efficiency gain in the overall risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio.*

Bitcoin has welcomed major investments from the likes of Paul Tudor Jones, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and MicroStrategy. The endorsement from JPM comes at a time when institutional players are rushing to accumulate the digital asset. As per Bloomberg’s report, America’s oldest bank BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) has also announced plans to enable Bitcoin transactions for its clients.

The strategists were quick to add that cryptocurrencies should be viewed as an investment vehicle and opposed to being funding currencies like the USD or EUR. This appears to be contrary to earlier statements from other JPM analysts that called cryptocurrencies the “poorest hedge for major drawdowns in equities.”

An Evaluation of TSLA; What Value can it Realistically Reach this Decade?,"There's so much to cram into this DD/model that I'm going to try to keep each point brief.

&#x200B;

Table of contents:

1) First, what are the risks; Quick Notes

2) Master equation

	a) gaap earnings per EV

		i) model & explanation

		ii) dropping battery costs

		iii) increase in efficiency of manufacturing/innovation

		iv) regulator credits will vanish. Tesla is insanely profitable without them.

	b) EVs delivered

		i) why competition won't affect Tesla's sales

	c) P/E ratio

		i) reasons and justification for a 50 P/E

&#x200B;

1) I'll start with the risks to my valuation model: 

In my opinion, the biggest risk to Tesla is failing to execute on the growth plan. The biggest hindrance I can see for Tesla's valuation will be failing to achieve their 50% YoY growth targets.

If there's an actual economic recession where consumers have to drastically cut back spending, then Tesla would definitely suffer. But this risk is obvious, and probably applies to 99% of growth stocks. Side note: Tesla currently makes such good margin on their EVs, that they have the flexibility of dropping prices to meet demand; however, this would greatly cut into earnings and reinvesting into growth. 

And of course there's the silly, but still very valid, risk to the valuation of companies that the market takes an irrational dive of 20%+, and investors lose confidence in stocks for the foreseeable future. However, Tesla's growth target might still be attainable in this economic environment.

I do \*NOT\* see new EVs from other companies entering the market as a risk to Tesla. There are 80M auto sales globally every year. My model calculates that Tesla obtains 12.1M of the sales (in 2027). This leaves plenty of room for legacy automakers and new EV manufacturers to sell millions of their own EVs.

Quick Note: This model is based \*only\* on EV sales. This does not include solar and energy storage, AI, robotics, or FSD. I see 2027 as the peak year of profitability for Tesla EV sales (we'll see why in my model in section 2ai)

Another Note: My model below has a base case (based on 50% YoY growth as Tesla aims for), a bear case (based on 40% YoY growth), and a bull case (based on 60% YoY growth) i.e. in the event that Tesla fails to execute on 50% YoY growth, achieving only 40%, then the bear case shows how the numbers could be affected

&#x200B;

2) I'd like to start with a simple equation, and expand on the details of the equation. This is for year 2027:

$12,000 gaap earnings per EV \* 12,100,000 EVs delivered \* 50 P/E = $7.2T market cap or approximately $7000/share

Sections 2a, 2b and 2c will be the reasoning behind $12k gaap earnings per ev, 12.1M EVs delivered, and 50 P/E respectively

2a) This gaap earnings per EV metric will be the most difficult to explain. I'll start with my model and an explanation

2ai) Here's my model: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12\_Qp2gXP1HV3EC5UOWBytx6Kn5dfNftqkTo0EwP0Ua8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12_Qp2gXP1HV3EC5UOWBytx6Kn5dfNftqkTo0EwP0Ua8/edit?usp=sharing)

Note: non-gaap earnings per EV through 2021 by quarter: $5628, $8060, $8622, $9208

Explanation of model: Warning, this is incredibly detailed. I'm going to try to keep the explanation as simple as possible, and I'm more than happy to answer any questions. 

Note: I wrote this DD before Q4 earnings came out, and I decided to leave that data point so you can actually see that my prediction was $2.48 non-GAAP earnings (not bad, huh? actual was $2.54)

The black numbers are known numbers (from 2020 Q3 to 2021 Q3). The red numbers are unknown, but projected numbers. From known numbers in the ER reports I was able to calculate ASP (average selling price, i.e. total auto revenue/evs delivered), COG per EV (cost of goods per EV, i.e. ASP\*(1- gross margin)), earnings per EV ((non-GAAP EPS\*outstanding shares)/EV delivered), and I was also able to calculate a sort of ""operational/manufacturing cost per EV"" by this equation:

ASP - COG per EV - earnings per EV = ""operational"" cost per EV

Here's a beautiful illustration of this equation:

[https://imgur.com/a/9vJcx0u](https://imgur.com/a/9vJcx0u)

So now that we have ASP, COG per EV, earnings per EV, an ""operational"" cost per EV and EVs delievered.. how do I project to get the red numbers? I extrapolated using exponential decay. Based on the rates that ASP, COG per EV and ""operational"" cost per EV were already falling, I took that rate and extrapolated out using an exponential decay model. I also assumed 50% YoY growth in EVs delievred (or 10.66% QoQ compounding). 

The math for exponential decay was pretty annoying. For anyone interseted, here's the recursive equation: P1 = (P0 - b)\*(1 - r) + b where P1 is one iteration past P0, b is the asymptote and r is the rate of decay. Solving for r gives r = 1-(P1-b)/(P0-b), and so I calculated the average r from the past 4 or 5 iterations to ""use"" the existing rate of decay. Interesting fact, I had to assume some 'asymptotes' for ASP, COG per EV and operational cost per EV, but if you look at my bear, base and bull cases where I've modified them, you'll see a very little difference in the outlook. The main difference between the base, bull and bear cases is simply growth of sales.

So now that I've extrapolated ASP, COG per EV, ""operational"" cost per EV and EVs delivered.. I can now calculate the project non-GAAP earnings per EV via the equation I used above: 

earnings per EV = ASP - COG per EV - ""operational"" cost per EV

this one: [https://imgur.com/a/9vJcx0u](https://imgur.com/a/9vJcx0u)

After finding earnings per EV, divide by the projected EVs delivered, and then by outstanding shares and you have the non-GAAP EPS estimates.

Now for some interesting (but not very pretty) graphs. Again, take 2029 and 2030 with a grain of salt. The S-curve will flatten

This is my favorite graph. Through no design of my own, but only from exponential decay extrapolations of other metrics, the non-GAAP earnings per EV graph tops out in 2027 as the year we'll see peak profitability per EV.

&#x200B;

ok, so why do we see dropping ASP, COG and operational costs?

2aii) Dropping battery costs can be summed up with Wright's Law (Cathie Wood was one of the early TSLA investors that spoke of Wright's Law). Battery costs were as high as $1000/kWh\*\* when Tesla first started building the original Roadster. It has since dropped to $100/kWh, and is expected to drop to $50 or less per kWh.

\*\*reference to $1000/kWh: J.B. Straubel, former CTO of Tesla, interview: [https://youtu.be/aWR5-mo8f1g?t=1520](https://youtu.be/aWR5-mo8f1g?t=1520)

Here is an excellent reference to declining battery costs as presented by Tony Seba. This presentation was centered around upcoming innovative and disruptive technologies: [https://youtu.be/Kj96nxtHdTU?t=405](https://youtu.be/Kj96nxtHdTU?t=405)

&#x200B;

2aiii) ""Tesla isn't profitable!"" we heard for years. This is because they were burning cash for R&D. They've made their manufacturing more efficient with innovations like the structural battery pack and gigacasting, and with 2 new factories we'll see even more benefits from Economies of Scale\*\*\*. Also, as Tesla opens Austin to serve the east coast US, and Berlin to serve Europe we'll see decreased shipping costs. This will cause the ""operational/manufacturing"" cost per EV to drop.

\*\*\*[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economiesofscale.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economiesofscale.asp)

&#x200B;

2aiv) regulatory credits were 13% of earnings in 2021 Q3, and 11% of earnings in 2021 Q4. But I'm not sure I need to make a bull case for collecting free money.

&#x200B;

2b) Will Tesla deliver 12M EVs in 2027? This is a fundamental risk for my model, as stated above. If Tesla maintains their 50% YoY sales growth, then they will sell 12M in 2027. We'll see. However, one thing for certain will not change Tesla sales:

&#x200B;

2bi) Competition. Tesla has \*always\* had competition. They had competition in 2013 to their Model S, and they have competition today. It's the ICE car, and Tesla is still managing to sell every EV they make. A couple points to make here:

I wont get into this point too much. It took Tesla 5 years from their first mass produced EV until they managed positive Free Cash Flow (2013 Model S until 2018). It's not exactly a one-to-one comparison for other companies, but Ford, GM, Rivian, Lucid and others will need at least a couple years to achieve positive free cash flow on the EV segment of their business. But let's say all of them succeed in making a nice commercially viable, and profitable EV..

My next point is that the EV market is expanding \*rapidly\*. New EV models will not likely take sales from Tesla. They will take sales from the Toyota Corolla, RAV4, Camry, Honda Civic, Accord, Hyundai cars, Volkwagen cars, etc. as we've already witnessed. There's no reason to believe that any new EVs entering the market will take meaningful sales from other EVs instead of gas cars.

&#x200B;

2c) The P/E ratio will always be a guess. Tesla will be a company with a presence in EV sales, solar and energy storage, large commercial power storage, and potentially FSD software subscriptions and AI driven bots. I believe (assuming a bull market) that there will still be enough frenzy surrounding Tesla to see a 100 P/E in 2027. The conservative side of me calculates these numbers with 50. By the time the S-Curve flattens, the P/E could be 30.. or maybe 60 like Amazon? It's hard to say where Tesla will be in 2030, but they've always innovated and come up with new ideas.

&#x200B;

There is one thing I confident about though; Tesla should \*never\* be trading at Toyota, Ford, or GM's P/E ratios. The ICE car is a dead technology, not dropping in price like the EV, and is proving to be far inferior to EVs in every way. Plus legacy automakers are not growing (some have \*lost\* sales for the last 2 years). It took Tesla investing billions over a decade to bring down battery costs, and make the EV commercially viable. Something legacay automakers have never done.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I hope you guys liked this DD. I'll try to have discussion with you guys in the comments if you'd like. If you have a bearish counterpoint, then I'm all about discussing it; however, it will help me (and both of us) if you point out which part of this equation it affects:

$12,000 gaap earnings per EV \* 12,100,000 EVs delivered \* 50 P/E = $7260/share

so that we can establish the point of disagreement.

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading!",investing,TSLA,"An Evaluation of TSLA; What Value can it Realistically Reach this Decade?

Tesla is insanely profitable without them. b) EVs delivered i) why competition won't affect Tesla's sales c) P/E ratio i) reasons and justification for a 50 P/E &; 1) I'll start with the risks to my valuation model: In my opinion, the biggest risk to Tesla is failing to execute on the growth plan. The biggest hindrance I can see for Tesla's valuation will be failing to achieve their 50% YoY growth targets. If there's an actual economic recession where consumers have to drastically cut back spending, then Tesla would definitely suffer. But this risk is obvious, and probably applies to 99% of growth stocks. Side note: Tesla currently makes such good margin on their EVs, that they have the flexibility of dropping prices to meet demand; however, this would greatly cut into earnings and reinvesting into growth. And of course there's the silly, but still very valid, risk to the valuation of companies that the market takes an irrational dive of 20%+, and investors lose confidence in stocks for the foreseeable future. However, Tesla's growth target might still be attainable in this economic environment. I do \*NOT\* see new EVs from other companies entering the market as a risk to Tesla. There are 80M auto sales globally every year. My model calculates that Tesla obtains 12.1M of the sales (in 2027). This leaves plenty of room for legacy automakers and new EV manufacturers to sell millions of their own EVs. Quick Note: This model is based \*only\* on EV sales. This does not include solar and energy storage, AI, robotics, or FSD. I see 2027 as the peak year of profitability for Tesla EV sales (we'll see why in my model in section 2ai) Another Note: My model below has a base case (based on 50% YoY growth as Tesla aims for), a bear case (based on 40% YoY growth), and a bull case (based on 60% YoY growth) i.e. in the event that Tesla fails to execute on 50% YoY growth, achieving only 40%, then the bear case shows how the numbers could be affected &; 2) I'd like to start with a simple equation, and expand on the details of the equation.

Why the $TSLA bubble will not burst?,"A correction (\~-20%) can happen, but the bubble will not burst (where $TSLA loses more than 50%-90% of its value). Here's why:  

So a lot of people often use the dotcom bubble as a parallel to speculate the pop of the Tesla bubble. The most immediate comparisons come from names such as Amazon, which lost nearly 90% of its value from the peak of the bubble but was eventually able to gain back most of its shares. Other comparisons also include stocks such as Yahoo, which was actually added to the S&P 500 in 1999, right before the bubble burst, or even Qualcomm/Cisco. 

These speculations and comparisons are always interesting to think about. They come from deductions, aka where you extrapolate data points from the past in order to predict what is going to happen in the future. However, a deduction is often not the most useful mental model, especially when circumstances are different in the future. And this is one of those cases where the circumstances are actually very different. 

Now the basic argument of ""Tesla is not a car company"" is often overused. Yes, Tesla creates batteries, they are going into the autonomous market soon, their AutoPilot is one of the best AI that the world has today (stronger than NVIDIA's GPUs), they are going to get into the insurance game, they are going to get into the financing industry, some people might even say they are going to collaborate with Space X to create flying cars in 2050. That's all great. However, I'm actually going to argue that despite all of these things, Tesla's current price is overvalued but yet, the stock will not burst. And this has in large part to do with how the markets and trader psychology works today, and how different it is from 1999/2000:

As information and financial data has become more widely available through the internet, the markets have had a tendency to price things way ahead of it's time. For example, Tesla believers (bloggers/Youtubers/communities) can now share their bull case for Tesla and what the company will do years and years down the line. While CEOs and company personnel are not allowed to share such projections due to SEC rules, there is nothing stopping these communities from doing so. The most prominent of this has perhaps been Cathie Wood's ARK Invest. She laid out the case for Tesla way back in 2017, and as some of her projections (such as Tesla's profitability) have proven to be correct, people have now become believers that her entire bull case (of Tesla owning the entire autonomous space) will eventually be correct. In a way, the market has become this binary mechanism. FOMO kicks in due to the widespread information that is available, and people pile in. Now, most Tesla bulls believe in the $7000 PT (pre-split) that Cathie Wood has put on this stock, and I doubt very many people are going to be willing to sell before that price. In 1999, if a hedge fund manager was very bullish on a stock, most other investors had no way of knowing. There has been trend towards open-sourcing investing ideas from many investors, and this is a massive deal with Tesla. Other examples of this include Rob Baron or Chamath, who are also very famous investors and well-known Tesla bulls. 20 years ago, investing ideas were supposed to be secretive, with retail investors very much out of the know and speculating on their own. This is no longer the case today. 

In a way, we now live in an investing world of stories, where the story of a stock matters more than the numbers, and these stories get reverberated through social media communities. What a company will do 20 years down the line is a story that is just now more widely available. So even if Tesla stock drops by 10-15% tomorrow, I believe that there are enough believers in this story where they will just continue to buy up the stock from those prices. ""Buy the dip"" has become this sort of motto in many of these investing communities, and this same theory is true for any of these companies that seem to be outlandishly valued as Tesla. 

The bottom line is: As long as the story stays, the bubble of Tesla will not pop. Even if Tesla has a bad quarter but their long term outlook stays the same, I very much think this will stand true. The only way this bubble pops is if the story changes somehow. That can either be from investors such as ARK saying they no longer believe in the long term hypothesis or other events such as the death of Elon Musk.

"Long on TSLA equity, waiting for another dip","Thinking of holding a long position on Tesla if the price drops to 150. It's a bit of a gamble, but their new model being released in 2025 will have better profit margins than the sway of declining margins in the EV industry and Musk potentially gaining 25% of voting rights whilst semi autocratic could help them catch up in AI or specifically robotics which seems to be slightly neglected in the AI race and VC funding.

>Oct 25 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) surpassed $1 trillion in market value on Monday after landing its biggest-ever order from rental car company Hertz, a deal that reinforced the electric car leader's ambitions to top the entire auto industry in sales over the next decade.

>Tesla shares surged as much as 14.9% to $1,045.02, making it the world's most valuable automaker according to Reuters calculations based on its latest filing.

>Even Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk expressed surprise at the velocity of the surge. ""Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem,"" Musk tweeted in reply to a comment by Ross Gerber, co-founder of the investment fund Gerber Kawasaki and a Tesla shareholder.

>""Wild $T1mes!"" Musk wrote in a separate tweet.

>Tesla is the first carmaker to join the elite club of trillion-dollar companies that includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).

>Most automakers do not boast about sales to rental car companies, often made at discounts to unload slow-selling models. But for Tesla and its investors, Hertz's decision to order 100,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of 2022 showed electric vehicles are no longer a niche product, but will dominate the mass car market in the near future.

>""Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,"" Hertz interim Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters.

>Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has set an annual sales growth target of 50%, on average, eventually reaching 20 million vehicles a year. That would be more than twice the volume of current sales leaders Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T).

>""We want to be a leader in mobility. ... Getting customers experience with electrified vehicles is an absolute priority for us.""

>Tesla's cheapest Model 3 sedan starts at about $44,000, making this order worth about $4.4 billion, if the entire order were for its mass-market sedan.

>Fields declined to say how much Hertz was paying for the order. Tesla was not immediately available for comment.

>With the current order, Hertz said EVs will make up more than 20% of its global fleet. Fields cited the rising number of EVs for sale and consumer interest in electrified vehicles.

"Tesla, snubbed by the S&P 500, quickly completes $5 billion stock sale","The old Wall Street adage is to ""sell high."" Tesla did just that.

A week ago, Tesla announced it would sell $5 billion worth of stock at market prices ""from time to time."" Tuesday it announced it had completed that sale as of Friday.

The exact number of shares sold, and thus the average price of each sale, was not disclosed. Tesla shares have fallen sharply in the recent sell-off of tech stocks. Shares reached a split-adjusted record high close of $498.32 on August 31, but have lost 16% of their value since then through Friday's close. And shares were down another 11% in pre-market trading even before the Tuesday's filing.


The sell-off could be because Tesla was not added to the S&P 500 index, as many investors were expecting would happen, given its market value and recent record of sustained profitability. Being added to the S&amp;amp;P would have forced additional purchases by fund managers whose holders must mirror the blue chip index.

Shares of Tesla are still up about 400% since the start of the year, even with last week's sell-off.

The sale of stock is the second such offering Tesla has done this year to take advantage of the skyrocketing stock price. In February the company raised $2.3 billion through the sale of 3 billion shares. Adjusted for the recent split, that stock sale was at an average price of $151.60 a share.

CEO Elon Musk dismissed the idea of the need for sales of additional shares when asked about it by analysts in January.

“We're actually spending money as quickly as we can spend it sensibly,"" Musk said on a January 29 call, when the company posted its first annual profit. ""There is no artificial hold back on expenditures ... So in light of that, it doesn't make sense to raise money.""

But soon thereafter Tesla decided it didn't make sense to not take advantage of its climbing share price. And if it turns out that its shares hit a peak last week that it might not reach again for a little while, then Tesla apparently sold additional shares at close to that high point.

"Ford’s MachE – a examination of Tesla’s competition, with $TSLA implications","
TL/DR upfront:

Upcoming EV competition is *the* driving DD behind the Tesla bear narrative: that EV competition will show up à market competition will drive EV prices (and therefore $TSLA margins) down to industry-norms. I think this reasoning is flawed. Ford’s unprofitability with the MachE provides a window into what the competition is facing, and why Tesla is *very likely* to retain supply capped demand and see robust gross margin growth--insulated from the effects of market competition—for several years (until \~ 2026-2028). 

\---- 

Argument:

**Fords issues with EV profitabili**ty (link:  [Ford CFO says inflation has erased Mustang Mach-E profits, but isn't hurting demand (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/ford-cfo-says-inflation-has-erased-mustang-mach-e-profits-but-isnt-hurting-demand.html) ) i**s a** **PROXY** **for legacy auto’s outlook writ large.** 

Ford’s ‘Tesla Killer’ is their Mach E, which is a BEV (full battery) crossover SUV. However, recently Ford announced that they get zero profit from sales of their Mach E. Price information is below. 

* The ‘Standard Range’ RWD (68kwh battery, 230 miles EPA range, the lowest $ base model) is $42,895 before dealer markups and delivery fees
* The ‘Extended Range’ (88kwh, 300 miles EPA, the lowest $ long range model) is $52,000 before dealer/delivery

Fords lack of Mach-E profitability is VERY interesting because the car is highly priced while also benefiting from several cost-lowering factors:

* $7,500 U.S. federal EV subsidy (Ford has yet to hit the 200,000 vehicle cap for the $7500, at which point it gradually decreases). Tesla buyers do not qualify for any EV tax credits right now. 
* Made in Mexico with cheaper, non-unionized labor 
* Usage of large pouch-style batteries, which are cheaper but lower-quality
* A more battery-efficient Car form-factor (as compared to a truck), meaning less batteries for a desired range and, therefore, lower cost of production. 

If Ford is unprofitable with a high-priced EV benefiting from $7,500, made in Mexico with lower priced components, how are they going to be profitable with the F150 Lightning? The F150 lightning will,

* Be made by Union labor at U.S. labor prices 
* Have a less-efficient form factor (truck aerodynamics are very bad)
* Have higher User battery needs (towing range). 
   * F150 lightning loses 50% of its range when towing a 23-foot airstream trailer. Add to this cold-weather battery reductions, heating needs, going up inclines…the trucks 230 mile range’s real drivable radius when towing can get extremely limited very quickly. 
* See a gradually reduced subsidy amount ($7,500 --> $3750 --> $1875) 

It is very possible that the F150 Lightning begins to see razor-thin profit margins (or none at all) over the near future. 

Additionally, Ford has additional issues it has to tackle:

* Growing percentages of EV sales will reduce dealership income (most of which is derived from maintenance and repair), leading to more pervasive markups
* A need to develop a ‘supercharging’ network. 
   * Look more deeply into their published numbers—if you nix Tesla’s superchargers (which they can access rn), as Tesla will jack up prices for non-Tesla’s over time (especially when the supercharger network begins to get overburdened), and eliminate low-power chargers, look closely in your area at the ACTUAL NUMBER of high power charging stations individually. There may be chargepoint nodes in your area, but at least in Atlanta, the total stalls are very low. 
* Battery supply shortages --> higher prices for batteries
   * This is why Fords CEO has been talking about the need for federal support with battery raw material production 

**SO WHAT?**

1.  Ford has to raise prices—they have no other choice. 
   1. None of the sub-bullets above (dealership cut, need for expanded charger network, declining subsidy $, higher priced U.S. labor, higher priced batteries with less-efficient form factors) is easily solvable. While Ford talks about separating EVs from its dealership network, that legal fight will take YEARS.  
2. This same situation will manifest in other legacy automakers 
3. Legacy auto debt levels (looking at Ford and VW, in particular) mean they can’t afford to produce less cars or see zero profit.
4. Therefore, legacy auto has significant pressure to maintain high prices
5. Tesla is, therefore, insulated from the price reduction and gross margin contracting effects of market competition. 

Add to this several Tesla-phenomena 

1. Tesla’s cost of production will continue to decline, meaning that gross margins will continue to expand 
   1. Technology reasons: dime-casting, structural battery, and 4680 (if it continues to scale) batteries 
   2. Economies of scale reasons: Tesla is centralizing serious production capacity in its main four factories. 50% CAGR can be achieved for several years with the current factory footprint alone. Austin is projected to eventually produce 2 million units alone, per year. I would doubt these projections if it wasn’t for Tesla’s record setting CAGR—which has surprised the entire industry over the past three years. 
2. Therefore, because Tesla has more ‘buffer’ to decrease prices—in an environment that is continuing to improve and in the context that legacy auto faces), Tesla has the ability to win any price war for several years into the future 

Conclusion

Tesla will be able to maintain supply capped demand for its cars and will have minimal pressure on gross margins from market competition for several years into the future. While some legacy auto (VW) MIGHT produce EVs in large numbers, this will not negatively impact Tesla gross margins. 

Would **love** for folks to put forward a strong counter argument. I have several $TSLA 2024 leaps and, if I am wrong in my assumptions here, would muuuuuch rather know that my thinking is faulty than continue to sit on this volatile position.

edit @ 622pm est. A few of you have pointed out that I am assuming tesla costs of production go down, but don't say the same for legacy. What I am trying to say here is that legacy production cost decreases HAVE to go down just to maintain current profitability levels as they lose the $7500 subsidy, begin making cars with UNIONized American labor, with (for the F150 L) less efficient form factors. No, I don't have the numbers for this because I'm not omnipotent--but consider: these are serious headwinds. 7500 is a HUGE subsidy on a 43,000 dollar car. Union labor is way, way more expensive than Mexican labor. 7500 alone is a huge moat to cross when you're not profitable with that 7500 subsidy.",investing,Tesla,"Ford’s MachE – a examination of Tesla’s competition, with $TSLA implications TL/DR upfront: Upcoming EV competition is *the* driving DD behind the Tesla bear narrative: that EV competition will show up à market competition will drive EV prices (and therefore $TSLA margins) down to industry-norms. I think this reasoning is flawed. Ford’s unprofitability with the MachE provides a window into what the competition is facing, and why Tesla is *very likely* to retain supply capped demand and see robust gross margin growth--insulated from the effects of market competition—for several years (until \~ 2026-2028). \---- Argument: **Fords issues with EV profitabili**ty (link: [Ford CFO says inflation has erased Mustang Mach-E profits, but isn't hurting demand (cnbc.com)]( ) i**s a** **PROXY** **for legacy auto’s outlook writ large.** Ford’s ‘Tesla Killer’ is their Mach E, which is a BEV (full battery) crossover SUV. However, recently Ford announced that they get zero profit from sales of their Mach E. Price information is below. * The ‘Standard Range’ RWD (68kwh battery, 230 miles EPA range, the lowest $ base model) is $42,895 before dealer markups and delivery fees * The ‘Extended Range’ (88kwh, 300 miles EPA, the lowest $ long range model) is $52,000 before dealer/delivery Fords lack of Mach-E profitability is VERY interesting because the car is highly priced while also benefiting from several cost-lowering factors: * $7,500 U.S. federal EV subsidy (Ford has yet to hit the 200,000 vehicle cap for the $7500, at which point it gradually decreases). Tesla buyers do not qualify for any EV tax credits right now. * Made in Mexico with cheaper, non-unionized labor * Usage of large pouch-style batteries, which are cheaper but lower-quality * A more battery-efficient Car form-factor (as compared to a truck), meaning less batteries for a desired range and, therefore, lower cost of production. If Ford is unprofitable with a high-priced EV benefiting from $7,500, made in Mexico with lower priced components, how are they going to be profitable with the F150 Lightning? The F150 lightning will, * Be made by Union labor at U.S. labor prices * Have a less-efficient form factor (truck aerodynamics are very bad) * Have higher User battery needs (towing range). * F150 lightning loses 50% of its range when towing a 23-foot airstream trailer. Add to this cold-weather battery reductions, heating needs, going up inclines…the trucks 230 mile range’s real drivable radius when towing can get extremely limited very quickly. * See a gradually reduced subsidy amount ($7,500 --> $3750 --> $1875) It is very possible that the F150 Lightning begins to see razor-thin profit margins (or none at all) over the near future. Additionally, Ford has additional issues it has to tackle: * Growing percentages of EV sales will reduce dealership income (most of which is derived from maintenance and repair), leading to more pervasive markups * A need to develop a ‘supercharging’ network. * Look more deeply into their published numbers—if you nix Tesla’s superchargers (which they can access rn), as Tesla will jack up prices for non-Tesla’s over time (especially when the supercharger network begins to get overburdened), and eliminate low-power chargers, look closely in your area at the ACTUAL NUMBER of high power charging stations individually. There may be chargepoint nodes in your area, but at least in Atlanta, the total stalls are very low. * Battery supply shortages --> higher prices for batteries * This is why Fords CEO has been talking about the need for federal support with battery raw material production **SO WHAT?** 1. Ford has to raise prices—they have no other choice. 1. None of the sub-bullets above (dealership cut, need for expanded charger network, declining subsidy $, higher priced U.S. labor, higher priced batteries with less-efficient form factors) is easily solvable. While Ford talks about separating EVs from its dealership network, that legal fight will take YEARS. 2. This same situation will manifest in other legacy automakers 3. Legacy auto debt levels (looking at Ford and VW, in particular) mean they can’t afford to produce less cars or see zero profit. 4. Therefore, legacy auto has significant pressure to maintain high prices 5. Tesla is, therefore, insulated from the price reduction and gross margin contracting effects of market competition. Add to this several Tesla-phenomena 1. Tesla’s cost of production will continue to decline, meaning that gross margins will continue to expand 1. Technology reasons: dime-casting, structural battery, and 4680 (if it continues to scale) batteries 2. Economies of scale reasons: Tesla is centralizing serious production capacity in its main four factories. 50% CAGR can be achieved for several years with the current factory footprint alone. Austin is projected to eventually produce 2 million units alone, per year. I would doubt these projections if it wasn’t for Tesla’s record setting CAGR—which has surprised the entire industry over the past three years. 2. Therefore, because Tesla has more ‘buffer’ to decrease prices—in an environment that is continuing to improve and in the context that legacy auto faces), Tesla has the ability to win any price war for several years into the future Conclusion Tesla will be able to maintain supply capped demand for its cars and will have minimal pressure on gross margins from market competition for several years into the future. While some legacy auto (VW) MIGHT produce EVs in large numbers, this will not negatively impact Tesla gross margins. Would **love** for folks to put forward a strong counter argument.

Are people reading too far into Tesla’s stock losses?,"Their share price has declined considerably over the past year. Part of that is obviously due to a general decline in equities, with the s&p500 down 20% this year. More of that is due to the general decline in tech stocks (which is what Tesla is generally regarded as), as the nasdaq is down 33% this year. But Tesla went even further than that, and is down 66% this year. 

The reasons people ascribe to this are generally either that the company is in trouble or that it’s because Elon isn’t there to right the ship (or both). But what if Tesla was just dramatically overpriced and it’s only now coming down to earth as first time retail investors who pumped money into stocks irrespective of fundamentals or even sound qualitative reasoning exit the market (which for the past 2 years held, by %, an unusually large proportion of Tesla’s shares)? What if, in a poor macro environment, people have just lost an appetite for risky assets? 

What if, and I know this is speculative, a stock that people were paying $1100 for each $1 in earnings for in 2020 *may* have been overpriced?

On top of all of that, I think some may have overestimated the size of Tesla’s moat and how difficult it would be for other car makers to catch up, and also may have failed to consider the strain increased competition would place on the vital and not exactly abundant supply of inputs necessary to make EVs. But I don’t think this point must necessarily be true to explain Tesla’s share price decline given what I said above. But I do think to some extent the current explanations for Tesla’s share price decline are the result of our tendency to look for a single person to blame for adverse outcomes - although I am not entirely condemning this view in this particular case as Elon being stretched this thin and spending so much time at twitter is objectively cause for some concern.",investing,Tesla,"Are people reading too far into Tesla’s stock losses?

Two factors—both related  to 2021 performance—may be making investors more upbeat heading into  May.

It matters because according to  Ferragu, STMicro is Tesla’s sole supplier of silicon carbide,. He says  Tesla accounts for 80% of the company’s silicon-carbide sales, and that  sales of $550 million imply Tesla would produce as many as 1 million  vehicles.

*Musk Destroys Tesla Image in Germany* (14/12/2022)

https://www.spiegel.de/international/business/der-spiegel-survey-musk-destroys-tesla-image-in-germany-a-fcc01ca2-d5fe-4c57-ac11-b48a560771f7

Germans have a disastrous view of Tesla, with company founder Elon Musk's behavior hardly helping. Whether from a likeability or quality perspective, the Tesla brand is far behind its German competitors. 

Elon Musk, it would seem, is eager to drag his followers into the abyss of conspiracy theory credulity – but is anyone taking the bait? The top dog of Tesla and Twitter has never been shy when it comes to polarizing statements, of course, but even by his standards, the last several days have been disturbing for his willingness to make right-wing positions his own. He went after the U.S. virologist Anthony Fauci, he has made light of people who want to determine their own sexual identity and he has generally declared war on ""woke."" During an appearance in San Francisco, Musk was booed for several minutes, and actor Billy Baldwin launched a trend with the hashtag #BoycottTesla.

In Germany, the calls for boycott were hardly necessary. That is the clear message of a survey conducted on behalf of DER SPIEGEL by the public opinion research institute Civey. Some 47 percent of the auto enthusiasts surveyed responded that Musk’s current behavior has had a ""clearly negative"" influence on their opinion of Tesla. An additional 16 percent said their reaction has been ""rather negative."" Only 3 percent said they have a ""rather positive"" impression of Musk’s recent behavior, and an additional 6 percent rated their impression as ""clearly positive."" The survey was carried out between Dec. 1 to 9, prior to Musk’s most recent outbursts.

In late October, after Musk took over control of Twitter, a number of public reactions already began indicating that the image of Tesla, the world’s leading electric car brand, was taking a beating. Alena Buyx, chair of the German Ethics Council, said at the time that she was no longer interested in buying a Tesla. ""It’s something you can’t do anymore,” she said.

In the U.S., the public opinion research company Morning Consult reported that Tesla’s popularity has suffered a nosedive primarily among supporters of the Democratic Party, which have traditionally dominated the e-car market. Since the beginning of the year, trust in the Tesla brand had been trending downward only slightly, says Morning Consult, but that Musk’s acquisition of Twitter ""acted as a break in the dam."" Elon Musk’s polarizing personality, the consulting company found, is negatively impacting Tesla.

The new survey commissioned by DER SPIEGEL has now revealed the same impact on the company’s image in Germany as that seen in the U.S. – just nine months after the carmaker opened up a new gigafactory outside of Berlin. And in contrast to the U.S., where Tesla seems poised to replace at least some of its disaffected supporters with new fans among pro-Trump Republicans, the same dynamic is nowhere to be seen in Germany. The broad rejection of Musk’s persona is apparent across all age, professional and educational groups in the country and it is independent of gender, region, family status, degree, religion and political affiliation.

The only exception is among those who proclaim to be supporters of the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD), with only 35 percent of such respondents saying they had a negative reaction to Musk’s behavior. But even within this group, the negative reactions outweighed the positive (23 percent).

Even without explicit mention of Musk, only 9 percent of Germans said they find Tesla to be ""very"" or ""rather likeable."" Fully 69 percent, by contrast, said they found the manufacturer to be ""less"" or ""not at all likeable."" That makes Tesla by far the least popular company among large carmakers with production sites in Germany, a finding once again independent of political party preference.

The survey revealed more polarization when it comes to Germany’s tradition-rich luxury brands like Mercedes, Porsche, BMW and Audi, which are generally viewed negatively on the left side of the political spectrum, but more positively on the right, with center-left Social Democrats also showing a weakness for Audi. Mass producers like Volkswagen, Opel and Ford, by contrast, tend to be more balanced, or they trigger very little reaction at all. Only Tesla is viewed negatively across all political parties. Musk’s company generates the highest likeability ratings among university students (27 percent), those under the age of 30 (22 percent), voters for the far-left Left Party (21 percent) and civil servants (17 percent). In all cases, though, Tesla supporters make up a clear minority.

Tesla also isn’t able to rely on its aura of being a technological leader. In response to the Civey question as to whether respondents view the vehicles produced by the different brands as high-quality products, only 21 percent answered positively when it came to Tesla.

That value puts Tesla at the very back of the pack, behind even Ford and Opel, both of which are also produced in Germany but which belong to foreign companies. Traditional German producers received top marks on the quality question. But Tesla has also been the focus of numerous negative reports  in the U.S. when it comes to quality and safety, in part because of the disastrous press its driver assistance system has received.

The survey does not allow for conclusions to be drawn on general attitudes in favor of or against electric vehicles. Tesla is the only manufacturer on the list to specialize entirely in e-autos and leads the segment both in Germany and elsewhere in the world when it comes to the number of vehicles registered. But other brands are offering more and more battery-powered vehicles. From January to November, 52,000 new Teslas were registered in Germany, according to the KBA, the German agency responsible for motorized vehicle registration. That represents around one-seventh of all fully electric vehicles in the country, with VW hot on its heels.",investing,Tesla,"""Musk Destroys Tesla Image in Germany"" and the future of EV competition I often see interesting articles posted in this sub but don't think this was posted before even though it's over a week old now.

The broad rejection of Musk’s persona is apparent across all age, professional and educational groups in the country and it is independent of gender, region, family status, degree, religion and political affiliation. The only exception is among those who proclaim to be supporters of the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD), with only 35 percent of such respondents saying they had a negative reaction to Musk’s behavior. But even within this group, the negative reactions outweighed the positive (23 percent). Even without explicit mention of Musk, only 9 percent of Germans said they find Tesla to be ""very"" or ""rather likeable."" Fully 69 percent, by contrast, said they found the manufacturer to be ""less"" or ""not at all likeable."" That makes Tesla by far the least popular company among large carmakers with production sites in Germany, a finding once again independent of political party preference. The survey revealed more polarization when it comes to Germany’s tradition-rich luxury brands like Mercedes, Porsche, BMW and Audi, which are generally viewed negatively on the left side of the political spectrum, but more positively on the right, with center-left Social Democrats also showing a weakness for Audi. Mass producers like Volkswagen, Opel and Ford, by contrast, tend to be more balanced, or they trigger very little reaction at all. Only Tesla is viewed negatively across all political parties. Musk’s company generates the highest likeability ratings among university students (27 percent), those under the age of 30 (22 percent), voters for the far-left Left Party (21 percent) and civil servants (17 percent). In all cases, though, Tesla supporters make up a clear minority. Tesla also isn’t able to rely on its aura of being a technological leader. In response to the Civey question as to whether respondents view the vehicles produced by the different brands as high-quality products, only 21 percent answered positively when it came to Tesla. That value puts Tesla at the very back of the pack, behind even Ford and Opel, both of which are also produced in Germany but which belong to foreign companies. Traditional German producers received top marks on the quality question. But Tesla has also been the focus of numerous negative reports in the U.S. when it comes to quality and safety, in part because of the disastrous press its driver assistance system has received. The survey does not allow for conclusions to be drawn on general attitudes in favor of or against electric vehicles. Tesla is the only manufacturer on the list to specialize entirely in e-autos and leads the segment both in Germany and elsewhere in the world when it comes to the number of vehicles registered. But other brands are offering more and more battery-powered vehicles. From January to November, 52,000 new Teslas were registered in Germany, according to the KBA, the German agency responsible for motorized vehicle registration. That represents around one-seventh of all fully electric vehicles in the country, with VW hot on its heels.",0.049789380877742956,1

$TSLA: The DD of a lifetime. ,"Hello, everyone! As we all know, $TSLA is having their quarterly earnings, which is a big deal for some bears. But let’s crack down on the bear party just for a second and use *logical* reasoning for why TSLA might not end up in the gutter as many would think. 

1. Expectations are low, just like Q1 (will get back to this later).
2. Their shittiness is priced in already after Robotaxi event.
3. Elon Musk is a master stock manipulator. 

Keeping all of this in mind, this isn’t even the *real* part of this DD. The actual, most integral part is looking at Elon Musk’s Twitter, which I decided to keep a close look on the past couple of earnings reports. 

On the day of Tesla’s Q1, Elon Musk tweeted a total of 5 times, where the stock ended up going up 13% and then an additional 16% the next 2 weeks. 

On the day of Tesla Q2, Elon Musk didn’t tweet **anything**, and the stock ended up falling 14%. 

Seems like a pattern has been drawn up, huh? Elon tweets a bit when the Tesla stock is going to moon on earnings while he’s in a cocky mood, and is dead silent when Tesla is going to fall. 

Now guess how many times Elon Musk has tweeted *so far* today? 

*15 fucking times*. 

You heard that right, folks! 15 GODDAMN times. That’s triple the amount of tweets he had made on Q1, where the stock roared 13 - 15%! Meaning that Elon is much more confidence and cockier than he was in Q1! This man knows when his stock will fall and when it doesn’t, and he’s letting us know right below our own nose! 

All of this is a *clear* indicator that Tesla is going to the moon today and the next week to come, regardless of whether they beat estimates or not. I’m betting that Tesla WILL beat estimates simply because of Elon Musk’s tweets and the fact that everyone has low confidence in the stock as of late. 

This is your DD to buy calls. Whether you want free money or not is up to you. 

Positions: 15 minutes before market close, I’ll buy 3 217.5C exp. OCT. 25th.

Who thinks TSLA is going to miss earnings because cars are stored everywhere. ,"TSLA is having an enormous problem. First off I live in Austin and I drive by the plant every once in a while. They have cars stacked 4 and 5 high, looks like almost a 1,000 if not more. Cybertrucks too. They have finally caught up to demand and now have way too much supply. The CyberTruck is a dud. I canceled my order, so did everyone else I know. The Model Y and 3 seem to sell well but I rarely see a new model X or Y. So the high end has stopped moving. Plus they have lowered the prices so much they have destroyed the high margins they were making. Plaid has gone from almost $140k to less than $100k. That’s a lot of profit gone. Tesla dealerships have them stored to the Moon. Same thing cars stacked 4 and 5 high and parked all over the place. At other Dealerships I am being told by friends who live in other parts of the Country that it’s worse. 

The entire car industry is having massive issues but Ford and GM are not valued at 60xs forward earnings. 

I think Elon is going to try to preempt the Earnings disaster with his “RoboTaxi” announcement on the 10th. 1 week before earnings on the 16th. Try to ride the “AI” hype. 

Power-walls don’t sell, Solar does not pencil out, and they are not building a robot anytime soon.

But they still can’t make my dam Roadster, been on order for 4 years plus. 

Me thinking of taking out a nice Put position for the 16th. Short term Puts will be cheap and stock has rallied back over $250. Perfect timing to knock $50 bucks off the stock. 

That’s what happened last time.

The TA Gods have spoken to me in sleep, and after that I handcrafted this masterpiece TA: applying the anatomy of two most famous historical squeezy examples VW and TSLA to current GME","&#x200B;

[The GME thesis, which I aim to explain via the comparison with VW and TSLA \(daily chart\)](https://preview.redd.it/e96lpakez1z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=862612bd4206afdb06123d26047d374f8a07e176)

&#x200B;

Sup, honorable apecitizens! Recently I’ve been working on this fascinating piece of TA, and now I am finally ready to share that with [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msv8n1/tbh_i_only_trust_retards/). I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https://imgur.com/a/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.

Oh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities. Dafaq did I just write? - Dunno, but that's exactly what I meant!

# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Remember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche’s market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.

As the general public was finding out about Wendysking’s takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen’s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/):

What is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn’t pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.

**Now let’s take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**

[VWSS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)

Even though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement 🌈tool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.

In the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.

One may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it ""**Purple Haze**"".

Let's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the ""**Squeezy Grail**"", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the ""**Runway**""), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular ""**Squieezluminati Confirmed**"" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.

Especially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal 🌈 grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.

Not only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).

Pay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*

Noice, but let's move further.

# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly “is become meme, Destroyer of shorts”: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company’s shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.

Remember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla’s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla’s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.

&#x200B;

Dusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:

>The longest unprofitable short I’ve ever seen!

&#x200B;

Well, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:

https://preview.redd.it/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32

&#x200B;

While companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk’s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':

[TSLASS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/f0qbrpqn22z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=479c78e6763043f81e9ac2c75cf8a6c769d9eee4)

&#x200B;

Beautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!

Looking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \[important!\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?

And the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.

Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.

Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:

&#x200B;

>Coincidences mean you're on the right path - *Simon van Booy*

&#x200B;

>If you gaze long enough into an asshole, the asshole will gaze back into you - u/roman_axt

&#x200B;

Some additional food for thought from TSLA:

[For redditors with a different floor](https://preview.redd.it/gnd0yienc2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8b72e1671ad69cf871cde154ae386e52835e94a)

# Game stopped, or it is just a beginning?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:

[GMESS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ko1ppnasc2z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d3f7c2a78135696d66a0a70e8e2a34ad4a04dbf)

&#x200B;

At this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u/ControlTheNarrative, at least.

And so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.

Then, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.

Fibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.

Identifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:

[Fibos' initiation point zoomed in](https://preview.redd.it/t2ouren1d2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cd87d96bb42ac20451c86059295f7560c8c44e8)

&#x200B;

Why? Because this                        ☝️ is clearly where the fun started.

And now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They say, that coincidence doesn't happen a third time. I say, we shall see.

I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche’s market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares. As the general public was finding out about Wendysking’s takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen’s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding.

The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW). Pay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.* Noice, but let's move further. &; &; # Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly “is become meme, Destroyer of shorts”: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020 &; &; Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company’s shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company. Remember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla’s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla’s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions. &; Dusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is: >The longest unprofitable short I’ve ever seen! &; Well, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything: &; While companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk’s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**': [TSLASS, Daily Chart]( &; Beautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls! Looking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \[important!\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds? And the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again. Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*. Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here: &; >Coincidences mean you're on the right path - *Simon van Booy* &; >If you gaze long enough into an asshole, the asshole will gaze back into you - u/roman_axt &; Some additional food for thought from TSLA: [For redditors with a different floor]( &; &; # Game stopped, or it is just a beginning? &; &; I am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA: [GMESS, Daily Chart]( &; At this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u/ControlTheNarrative, at least. And so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above. Then, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action. Fibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself. Identifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze: [Fibos' initiation point zoomed in]( &; Why? Because this ☝️ is clearly where the fun started. And now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard? &; &; &; &; They say, that coincidence doesn't happen a third time. I say, we shall see. **TL;DR** is in the comments. P.S. Here is the most precious thing that I can offer you: my Crayon summative drawings: &; EDIT. Here you go boy, proof of beard: I also decided to raise my bets, so I will also shave my hairy legs, if I'm wrong: And yeah, the reddit avatar will also get the new style. &; EDIT 2.

Curious why Papa Elon is shilling $GME? It’s because Melvin Capital shorted $TSLA for years and bragged about it.,"Elon has battled shorts for almost a decade. We all remember when he complained that shorting should be illegal, and when he released “short shorts” when he finally defeated them. 

But guess who used to brag about shorting Tesla? Gabe 🌈🐻 Plotkin. 

From [Bloomberg:](https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2019-07-19/cohen-cub-gabriel-plotkin-sees-fund-surge-about-44-this-year)

Plotkin described Melvin as “a very human-intensive place. We have a lot of analysts, we require a lot out of them.” The team has modeled more than 500 companies in “significant detail,” while a data science group reads into trends.
He added that the firm has an “intense focus” on the short side, with about 70% of profits in Melvin’s first year coming from bearish bets. Plotkin expressed skepticism about mall real estate investment trusts, as well as electric-car maker Tesla Inc.

Those who think removing the EV tax credit will help Tesla are smoking some exotic copium. Here's my crystal ball.,"1. Trump removes $7,500 EV tax credits and imposes import tariffs on all imported EVs.
2. The US EV manufacturers are starved out, and Tesla is the only surviving US EV maker - I quote ""Tesla does not depend on subsidies"".
3. Tesla increases its US EV market share, seemingly as the only car manufacturer without risk of discontinuity.
4. Nonetheless, Tesla delivery numbers remain stagnant despite increased US market share due to lowering overall EV sales.
5. Tesla now monopolises the US EV market, significantly diluting the need to compete.
6. US import tariffs are now in full effect. Imported parts are too expensive, and cost-cutting is prioritised. Tesla's costly R&D takes a backseat.
7. China, Korea and the Germans retaliate by imposing tariffs on Tesla imports, crippling Tesla's global market EV share.
8. Chinese, Korean and German EV makers continue to improve EV capabilities in a 3-cornered fight, widening the tech gap to Tesla.
9. The difference in EVs has now become more apparent. Tesla now lacks value for money and is no longer relevant to the global market. The US is dethroned as a major EV leader.
10. Tesla now struggles to sustain revenue growth without the global market. It now struggles to justify its colossal trillion-dollar valuation. Tesla needs to milk the already-drying US harder, somehow.
11. A new generation of Tesla bag holders is created.

Tesla is a joke," I think Elon is lying to everyone again. He claims the tesla bot will be able to work a full day on a 2.3kwh battery. Full load on my mediocre Nvidia 3090 doing very simple AI inference runs up about 10 kwh in 24 hours. Mechanical energy expenditure and sensing aside, there is no way a generalized AI can run a full workday on 2.3kwh.

Now, you say that all the inference is done server side, and streamed back in forth to the robot. Let's say that cuts back energy expense enough to only being able to really be worrying about mechanical energy expense and sensing (dubious and generous). Now this robot lags even more than the limitations of onboard computing, and is a safety nightmare. People will be crushed to death before the damn thing even senses what it is doing.

That all being said, the best generalist robots currently still only have 3-6 hour battery life, and weigh hundreds of pounds. Even highly specialized narrow domain robots tend to max out at 8 hours with  several hundreds of pounds of cells onboard. (on wheels and flat ground no-less)

When are people going to realize this dude is blowing smoke up everyone's ass to inflate his garbage company's stock price.
