I think Alphabet (GOOGL) is the most undervalued stock in the stock market right now,"I am 100% invested in Alphabet due to several reasons. I think we are in a similar situation to Meta when it was faced with law suits, reached 90$ last year and everybody said it would die. 

1. Alphabet is growing in the double digits every year since its inception. Its PE is on the way to below 20 and laughably cheap for a tech company with that growth. 

3. They crushed earnings and the only reason for their slump afterwards was their heavy AI spending, which they can easily cut if they see its not worth it anymore. Also comparable to Meta.

2. Alphabet is a leader in innovative technologies such as autonomous driving. Tesla shot up 40% or something when Elon made another promise towards autonomous driving, while Google actually is the first mover and build up a network with hundred thousands of paying users. 

3. I dont think that AI will be as useful as some still expect. But in no way Google is endangered by that. I dont have more recent numbers, but in July Googles market share in the search business grew slightly, while ChatGPT declined by 12%. I think the summarised answers in Google search are already way more useful and convenient than what Bing or ChatGPT offers. 

4. If AI presents itself as useful Google and Meta will have the best model. People misunderstand how AI works. Its not the model which is important, its the underlying set of data. With the deal it closed with Reddit beginning of 2024, google honestly struck Gold for a really cheap price.

5. Tech companies are literally what keeps the american economy and influence in the world right now alive. I think its not realistic to think that the DOJ will do anything which substancially weakens an american tech company at this point. They will probably get a slap on the wrist in a way of a (big) fine. But priced in is currently a potential break up.

6. Atleast for the next earnings I expect an ad revenue ""short squeeze"" because of the really polarized american election. Way more money will be invested in ads than in previous elections, and while the sum on its own isnt that much, depending on how elastic the ad market is, it will drive up ad space for everyone involved.",stocks,GOOGL,"I think Alphabet (GOOGL) is the most undervalued stock in the stock market right now I am 100% invested in Alphabet due to several reasons.

$GOOGL Google is in a big trouble in the long run - here is why,"Let's do the math directly and take a look at Google ads results in 2023:

- The revenue generated by Google ads in 2023 is $237 billion.

- The revenue portion from Google search engine is around 60%!!! That means out of the $237 billion, around $142 billion revenue is generated from the search engine or search ads.

- Google's total revenue for 2023 was $305 billion, that means the revenue from the search engine only (not entire Google ads) makes around 45% of Google's total revenue.

Now the second search engine behind Google is Microsoft Bing, Microsoft generated in 2023 only $12 Billion from Bing ads.

Google by far is the dominant as for now, and Microsoft although in the second place behind them, won't be able to reach even a quarter of Google's revenue, they had many failed attempts to promote Bing.

Now some of you probably heared about the upcoming releases of SearchGPT, whoever tried ChatGPT will know it's by far better than Gemini and the other AI models, if Openai released their SearchGPT and people switched from Google search to SearchGPT (which I personally think will happen), Google in this case will keep 45% of its total revenue vulnerable by SearchGPT.

TL;DR Google have strong exposure to its search engine, the revenue generated from the search engine is around 45% of its total revenue, with the upcoming release of SearchGPT, Google may lose its dominance in the long term which may cause their revenue growth to stop or decline.

Bloomberg: US Considers a Rare Antitrust Move: Breaking Up Google,"A rare bid to break up Alphabet Inc.’s Google is one of the options being considered by the Justice Department after a landmark court ruling found that the company monopolized the online search market, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations.

The move would be Washington’s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Less severe options include forcing Google to share more data with competitors and measures to prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage in AI products, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations.

Regardless, the government will likely seek a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of its case against Google. If the Justice Department pushes ahead with a breakup plan, the most likely units for divestment are the Android operating system and Google’s web browser Chrome, said the people. Officials are also looking at trying to force a possible sale of AdWords, the platform the company uses to sell text advertising, one of the people said.

The Justice Department discussions have intensified in the wake of Judge Amit Mehta’s Aug. 5 ruling that Google illegally monopolized the markets of online search and search text ads. Google has said it will appeal that decision, but Mehta has ordered both sides to begin plans for the second phase of the case, which will involve the government’s proposals for restoring competition, including a possible breakup request.

Alphabet shares fell as much as 2.5% to $160.11 in after-hours trading before erasing some losses.

A Google spokesman declined to comment on the possible remedy. A Justice Department spokeswoman also declined to comment.

The US plan will need to be accepted by Mehta, who would direct the company to comply. A forced breakup of Google would be the biggest of a US company since AT&T was dismantled in the 1980s.

Justice Department attorneys, who have been consulting with companies affected by Google’s practices, have raised concerns in their discussions that the company’s search dominance gives it advantages in developing artificial intelligence technology, the people said. As part of a remedy, the government might seek to stop the company from forcing websites to allow their content to be used for some of Google’s AI products in order to appear in search results.

**Breakup**

Divesting the Android operating system, used on about 2.5 billion devices worldwide, is one of the remedies that’s been most frequently discussed by Justice Department attorneys, according to the people. In his decision, Mehta found that Google requires device makers to sign agreements to gain access to its apps like Gmail and the Google Play Store.

Those agreements also require that Google’s search widget and Chrome browser be installed on devices in such a way they can’t be deleted, effectively preventing other search engines from competing, he found.

Mehta’s decision follows a verdict by a California jury in December that found the company monopolized Android app distribution. A judge in that case hasn’t yet decided on relief. The Federal Trade Commission, which also enforces antitrust laws, filed a brief in that case this week and said in a statement that Google shouldn’t be allowed “to reap the rewards of illegal monopolization.”

Google paid as much as $26 billion to companies to make its search engine the default on devices and in web browsers, with $20 billion of that going to Apple Inc.

Mehta’s ruling also found Google monopolized the advertisements that appear at the top of a search results page to draw users to websites, known as search text ads. Those are sold via Google Ads, which was rebranded from AdWords in 2018 and offers marketers a way to run ads against certain search keywords related to their business. About two-thirds of Google’s total revenue comes from search ads, amounting to more than $100 billion in 2020, according to testimony from last year’s trial.

If the Justice Department doesn’t call for Google to sell off AdWords, it could ask for interoperability requirements that would make it work seamlessly on other search engines, the people said.

**Data Access**

Another option would require Google to divest or license its data to rivals, such as Microsoft’s Bing or DuckDuckGo. Mehta’s ruling found that Google’s contracts ensure not only that its search engine gets the most user data – 16 times as much as its next closest competitor — but that data stream also keeps its rivals from improving their search results and competing effectively.

Europe’s recently enacted digital gatekeeper rules imposed a similar requirement that Google make available some of its data to third-party search engines. The company has said publicly that sharing data can pose user privacy concerns, so it only makes available information on searches that meet certain thresholds.

Requiring monopolists to allow rivals to have some access to technology has been a remedy in previous cases. In the Justice Department’s first case against AT&T in 1956, the company was required to provide royalty-free licenses to its patents.

In the antitrust case against Microsoft, the settlement required the Redmond, Washington, tech giant to make some of its so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, available to third-parties for free. APIs are used to ensure that software programs can effectively communicate and exchange data with each other.

**AI Products**

For years, websites have allowed Google’s web crawler access to ensure they appear in the company’s search results. But more recently some of that data has been used to help Google develop its AI.

Last fall, Google created a tool to allow websites to block scraping for AI, after companies complained. But that opt-out doesn’t apply to everything. In May, Google announced that some searches will now come with “AI Overviews,” narrative responses that spare people the task of clicking through various links. The AI-powered panel appears underneath queries, presenting summarized information drawn from Google search results from across the web.

Google doesn’t allow website publishers to opt-out of appearing in AI Overviews, since those are a “feature” of search, not a separate product. Websites can block Google from using snippets, but that applies to both search and the AI Overviews.

While AI Overviews only appear on a fraction of searches, the feature’s roll-out has been rocky after some excerpts offered embarrassing suggestions, like advising people to eat rocks or to put glue on pizza.

"AI Wars: Google stock tumbles -5% premarket as Bard AI gives wrong answer at launch event, Microsoft to incorporate ChatGPT into Bing"," Google’s new AI-powered chatbot Bard has stumbled at the first hurdle after it gave a misleading response during a demonstration at a launch event this week.

The AI search assistant, unveiled on Tuesday, is used by Google to generate text summaries of search results.

Yet in an animated image of Google Bard in action distributed by Google to mark the new feature’s launch, it gives a wrong answer.

The falsehood will raise further questions about the accuracy of search engines and of AI-generated answers to humans’ questions.

In an animated GIF showing how Bard works, a user types in the search query ""what new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my 9 year old about?""

The NASA telescope was made operational in December 2021 and has been used by scientists to make several discoveries of new planets outside the Solar System.

One of the responses generated by Bard says: ""JWST took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system.""

Apparently that's a $20decillion, fine.

  
Google banned the ultra-nationalist Tsargrad channel from YouTube in 2020, in response to US sanctions imposed against its owner, but after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 more channels were added to the banned list. 

The court imposed a 100,000 rubles per day, equivalent to about $1,025, with the total fine doubling every week. Thanks to the compound interest Google has now racked up a fine which the Russian judge on Monday called ‘a case in which there are many, many zeroes’. There are so many zeroes, in fact that the total fine amount completely dwarfs global GDP, which the World Bank estimates at about $100trillion.

In its most recent earnings statement, it said: ‘We have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. ‘For example, civil judgments that include compounding penalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of sanctioned parties.

"Wiz walks away from $23 billion deal with Google, will pursue IPO ","Wiz has walked away from a $23 billion deal to be acquired by Google, in what would have been the search giant’s largest ever deal, telling employees it would pursue an initial public offering as it initially planned.

“Saying no to such humbling offers is tough,” Wiz co-founder Assaf Rappaport said in a memo obtained by CNBC to the company’s worldwide employee base.

The deal would have nearly doubled the $12 billion valuation of the startup from its most recent round of funding. Wiz was founded in 2020 and has grown at a rapid speed under Rappaport, who had been eyeing an IPO as recently as May. A person familiar with the company’s thinking cited both antitrust and investor concerns as part of the motivation behind the decision to walk away.

Wiz’s cloud security products include prevention, active detection and response — a range that has appealed to large firms and would have helped Google compete with Microsoft which also sells security software.

CNBC reported in July on the talks between Google and Wiz.

The company reportedly hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue after 18 months, and achieved $350 million in annual recurring revenue in 2023. It’s backed by a roster of blue-chip firms, including Israeli venture capitalist Cyberstarts, Index Ventures, Insight Partners and Sequoia Capital.

Google successfully acquired cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion in 2022. Google’s largest deal remains the acquisition of hardware maker Motorola in 2012 for $12.5 billion, which it ended up selling to Lenovo for $2.9 billion in 2014. As recently as last week, Google reportedly ended conversations to acquire sales software maker HubSpot.

Suwon-based Samsung, the world’s leading smartphone maker, is considering making the switch, putting at risk roughly $3 billion in annual revenue for Google, the report said.

Negotiations are still ongoing and Samsung may yet decide to keep Google as its default provider, according to the report.

"Google Cutting 12,000 Jobs in 6% Slash to Global Workforce","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-20/google-cutting-12-000-jobs-in-6-slash-to-global-workforce

Google parent Alphabet Inc. said it will cut about 12,000 jobs, more than 6% of its global workforce, becoming the latest tech giant to retrench after years of abundant growth and hiring.

The cuts will affect jobs globally and across the entire company, Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai told employees in an email on Friday, writing that he takes “full responsibility for the decisions that led us here.”

With the layoffs, Google joins a host of other tech giants that have drastically scaled back operations amid a faltering global economy and soaring inflation. Meta Platforms Inc., Twitter Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have all slashed their ranks. Thanks to a resilient search business, Google has been one of the longest tech holdouts avoiding major workforce reductions. But the company is dealing with a slowdown in digital advertising and its cloud-computing division continues to trail Amazon and Microsoft Corp. 

“These are important moments to sharpen our focus, reengineer our cost base, and direct our talent and capital to our highest priorities,” Pichai wrote in the email. 

He said the company has a “substantial opportunity in front of us” with artificial intelligence, a key investment area where Google is facing a surge in recent competition. 

In October, the company reported earnings and revenue that missed analyst expectations. Profit declined 27% to $13.9 billion compared to the prior year. At the time, Pichai said Google would curb its expenses and Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said the number of new jobs would fall by more than half in the fourth quarter from the previous period.

Google’s reduction in headcount follows investor pressure to adopt a more aggressive strategy to curb spending. In November, TCI Fund Management Ltd. urged the internet search giant in an open letter to publicly set a target for profit margins, increase share buybacks and reduce losses in its portfolio of Other Bets, Alphabet’s moonshot division. “The company has too many employees and the cost per employee is too high,” TCI Managing Director Chris Hohn said, noting that Alphabet’s headcount had swelled 20% per year since 2017.

According to the human-resources consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., the most job cuts in 2022 were in the tech sector — 97,171 for the year, up 649% compared to the previous year.

Google has made a series of cost-cutting moves in recent months, canceling the next generation of its Pixelbook laptop and permanently shuttering Stadia, its cloud gaming service. Earlier in January, Verily, a biotech unit of Alphabet, said it was cutting 15% of its staff. 

Pichai said Alphabet would be paying affected employees 16 weeks of severance and six months worth of health benefits in the US, with other regions receiving packages based on local laws and practices.",stocks,GOOGL,"Google Cutting 12,000 Jobs in 6% Slash to Global Workforce Google parent Alphabet Inc. said it will cut about 12,000 jobs, more than 6% of its global workforce, becoming the latest tech giant to retrench after years of abundant growth and hiring.

Google uses ‘double-Irish’ to shift $75.4bn in profits out of Ireland,"[https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/google-used-double-irish-to-shift-75-4bn-in-profits-out-of-ireland-1.4540519](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/google-used-double-irish-to-shift-75-4bn-in-profits-out-of-ireland-1.4540519)

&#x200B;

  

[Google](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_company=Google) shifted more than $75.4 billion (€63 billion) in profits out of the Republic using the controversial “double-Irish” tax arrangement in 2019, the last year in which it used the loophole.

The technology giant availed of the tax arrangement to move the money out of Google [Ireland](https://www.irishtimes.com/news) Holdings Unlimited Company via interim dividends and other payments. This company was incorporated in Ireland but tax domiciled in [Bermuda](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_location=Bermuda) at the time of the transfer.

The move allowed Google Ireland Holdings to escape corporation tax both in the Republic and in the [United States](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_location=United+States) where its ultimate parent, Alphabet, is headquartered. The holding company reported a $13 billion pretax profit for 2019, which was effectively tax-free, the accounts show.

A year earlier, Google Ireland Holdings paid out dividends of €23 billion, having recorded turnover of $25.7 billion.

Google has used the double Irish loophole to funnel billions in global profits through Ireland and on to Bermuda, effectively put them beyond the reach of US tax authorities.

Companies exploiting the double Irish put their intellectual property into an Irish-registered company that is controlled from a tax haven such as Bermuda. Ireland considers the company to be tax-resident in Bermuda, while the US considers it to be tax-resident here. The result is that when royalty payments are sent to the company, they go untaxed – unless or until the money is eventually sent home to the US parent.

The “double Irish” was abolished in 2015 for new companies establishing operations in the Republic. However, controversially, it allowed those already using it until the end of 2020 to phase it out.

Google overhauled its global tax structure and consolidated its intellectual property holdings back to the United States in early 2020, meaning 2019 was the final year in which it availed of the arrangement.

Up to late 2019, Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company was an intellectual property licensing company with turnover derived from the licensing of IP to subsidiaries. The accounts state it had no employees and that it was tax resident at the time in Bermuda, where the “standard rate tax is 0 per cent”.

Commenting on the movement of the profits out of its Irish unit, a spokeswoman for Google said: “In December 2019, in line with the OECD’s base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) conclusions and changes to US and Irish tax laws, we simplified our corporate structure and started licensing our IP from the US, not Bermuda. The accounts filed today cover the 2019 financial year, before we made those changes.

“Including all annual and one-time income taxes over the past ten years, our global effective tax rate has been over 20 per cent, with more than 80 per cent of that tax due in the US,” she added.

The accounts state that Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company became tax resident in Ireland from January 1st, 2021, and that it now just operates as a holding company.

Turnover for the holding company rose from $25.7 billion in 2018 to $26.5 billion in 2019. The increase was primarily due to a rise in turnover recorded by the company’s subsidiaries, which results in higher royalty payments.

Dividend income from shares in group undertakings jumped from just $2.9 million in 2018 to $597.5 million a year later. The accounts also show a $3 billion increase in research and development costs in 2019, with the company incurring R&D expenses of $10.4 billion under a cost-sharing agreement with other Google entities globally.

Google Ireland, the tech company’s main operating Irish subsidiary with over 4,000 employees, recorded €45.7 billion in revenues in 2019 with pretax profits amounting to €1.94 billion. It paid €263 million in tax that year, down nearly €9 million versus 2018.

It is estimated that US multinationals were holding more than a $1 trillion in profits offshore via mechanisms such as the double Irish and the so-called Dutch sandwich by the end of 2017. Tax cuts introduced by former US president [Donald Trump](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_person=Donald+Trump) in 2019 have led to some of those profits being repatriated to the United States.",stocks,GOOGL,"Google uses ‘double-Irish’ to shift $75.4bn in profits out of Ireland [ &; [Google]( shifted more than $75.4 billion (€63 billion) in profits out of the Republic using the controversial “double-Irish” tax arrangement in 2019, the last year in which it used the loophole.

Companies exploiting the double Irish put their intellectual property into an Irish-registered company that is controlled from a tax haven such as Bermuda. Ireland considers the company to be tax-resident in Bermuda, while the US considers it to be tax-resident here. The result is that when royalty payments are sent to the company, they go untaxed – unless or until the money is eventually sent home to the US parent. The “double Irish” was abolished in 2015 for new companies establishing operations in the Republic. However, controversially, it allowed those already using it until the end of 2020 to phase it out. Google overhauled its global tax structure and consolidated its intellectual property holdings back to the United States in early 2020, meaning 2019 was the final year in which it availed of the arrangement. Up to late 2019, Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company was an intellectual property licensing company with turnover derived from the licensing of IP to subsidiaries. The accounts state it had no employees and that it was tax resident at the time in Bermuda, where the “standard rate tax is 0 per cent”. Commenting on the movement of the profits out of its Irish unit, a spokeswoman for Google said: “In December 2019, in line with the OECD’s base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) conclusions and changes to US and Irish tax laws, we simplified our corporate structure and started licensing our IP from the US, not Bermuda. The accounts filed today cover the 2019 financial year, before we made those changes. “Including all annual and one-time income taxes over the past ten years, our global effective tax rate has been over 20 per cent, with more than 80 per cent of that tax due in the US,” she added. The accounts state that Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company became tax resident in Ireland from January 1st, 2021, and that it now just operates as a holding company. Turnover for the holding company rose from $25.7 billion in 2018 to $26.5 billion in 2019. The increase was primarily due to a rise in turnover recorded by the company’s subsidiaries, which results in higher royalty payments. Dividend income from shares in group undertakings jumped from just $2.9 million in 2018 to $597.5 million a year later. The accounts also show a $3 billion increase in research and development costs in 2019, with the company incurring R&D expenses of $10.4 billion under a cost-sharing agreement with other Google entities globally. Google Ireland, the tech company’s main operating Irish subsidiary with over 4,000 employees, recorded €45.7 billion in revenues in 2019 with pretax profits amounting to €1.94 billion. It paid €263 million in tax that year, down nearly €9 million versus 2018. It is estimated that US multinationals were holding more than a $1 trillion in profits offshore via mechanisms such as the double Irish and the so-called Dutch sandwich by the end of 2017. Tax cuts introduced by former US president [Donald Trump]( in 2019 have led to some of those profits being repatriated to the United States.",0.08606434717545827,1
Google in Crisis,"https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/inside-the-crisis-at-google


It’s not like artificial intelligence caught Sundar Pichai off guard. I remember sitting in the audience in January 2018 when the Google CEO said it was as profound as electricity and fire. His proclamation stunned the San Francisco audience that day, so bullish it still seems a bit absurd, and it underscores how bizarre it is that his AI strategy now appears unmoored.

The latest AI crisis at Google — where its Gemini image and text generation tool produced insane responses, including portraying Nazis as people of color — is now spiraling into the worst moment of Pichai’s tenure. Morale at Google is plummeting, with one employee telling me it’s the worst he’s ever seen. And more people are calling for Pichai’s ouster than ever before. Even the relatively restrained Ben Thompson of Stratechery demanded his removal on Monday. 


Yet so much — too much — coverage of Google’s Gemini incident views it through the culture war lens. For many, Google either caved to wokeness or cowed to those who’d prefer not to address AI bias. These interpretations are wanting, and frankly incomplete explanations for why the crisis escalated to this point. The culture war narrative gives too much credit to Google for being a well organized, politics-driven machine. And the magnitude of the issue runs even deeper than Gemini’s skewed responses. 

There’s now little doubt that Google steered its users’ Gemini prompts by adding words that pushed the outputs toward diverse responses — forgetting when not to ask for diversity, like with the Nazis — but the way those added words got there is the real story. Even employees on Google’s Trust and Safety team are puzzled by where exactly the words came from, a product of Google scrambling to set up a Gemini unit without clear ownership of critical capabilities. And a reflection of the lack of accountability within some parts of Google.

""Organizationally at this place, it's impossible to navigate and understand who's in rooms and who owns things,” one member of Google’s Trust and Safety team told me. “Maybe that's by design so that nobody can ever get in trouble for failure.”

Organizational dysfunction is still common within Google, something it’s worked to fix through recent layoffs, and it showed up in the formation of its Gemini team. Moving fast while chasing OpenAI and Microsoft, Google gave its Product, Trust and Safety, and Responsible AI teams input into the training and release of Gemini. And their coordination clearly wasn’t good enough. In his letter to Google employees addressing the Gemini debacle this week, Pichai singled out “structural changes” as a remedy to prevent a repeat, acknowledging the failure.

Those structural changes may turn into a significant rework of how the organization operates. “The problem is big enough that replacing a single leader or merging just two teams probably won’t cut it,” the Google Trust and Safety employee said.

Already, Google is rushing to fix some of the deficiencies that contributed to the mess. On Friday, a ‘reset’ day Google, and through the weekend — when Google employees almost never work — the company’s Trust and Safety leadership called for volunteers to test Gemini’s outputs to prevent further blunders. “We need multiple volunteers on stand-by per time block so we can activate rapid adversarial testing on high priority topics,” one executive wrote in an internal email. 

And as the crisis brewed internally, it escalated externally when Google shared the same type of opaque public statements and pledges about doing better that have worked for its core products. That underestimated how different the public’s relationship is with generative AI than other technology, and made matters worse. 

Unlike search, which points you to the web, generative AI is the core experience, not a route elsewhere. Using a generative tool like Gemini is a tradeoff. You get the benefit of a seemingly-magical product. But you give up control. While you may get answers quickly, or a cool looking graphic, you lose touch with the source material. To use it means putting more trust in giant companies like Google, and to maintain that trust Google needs to be extremely transparent. Yet what do we really know about how its models operate? Continuing on as it if were business as usual, Google contributed to the magnitude of the crisis.

Now, some close to Google are starting to ask if it’s focused in the right places, coming back to Pichai’s strategic plan. Was it really necessary, for instance, for Google to build a $20 per month chatbot, when it could simply imbue its existing technology — including Gmail, Docs, and its Google Home smart speakers — with AI?

There are all worthwhile questions, and the open wondering about Pichai’s job is fair, but the current wave of Generative AI is still so early that Google has time to adjust. On Friday, for instance, Elon Musk sued OpenAI for betraying its founding agreement, a potential setback for the company’s main competitor.

Google, which just released a powerful Gemini 1.5 model, will have at least a few more shots until a true moment for panic sets in. But everyone within the company knows it can’t afford many more of the previous week’s incidents, from Pichai to the workers pulling shifts this weekend.

Google announces Bard A.I. in response to ChatGPT,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/06/google-announces-bard-ai-in-response-to-chatgpt.html

Google blog post: https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/

Google on Monday announced an artificial intelligence chatbot technology called Bard that the company will begin rolling out in the coming weeks. The announcement confirms CNBC’s prior reporting. Bard will compete directly with rival ChatGPT, an AI service created by OpenAI.

Bard is powered by the company’s large language model LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications. Google will open up the conversation technology to “trusted testers” ahead of making it more widely available to the public, the company said in a blog post Monday.

Last week, CNBC reported that Google is testing some of these features with employees as part of a “code red” plan to respond to ChatGPT, the popular chatbot backed in part by Microsoft. Features included a chatbot called “Apprentice Bard,” as well as new search desktop designs that could be used in a question-and-answer format.

“Soon, you’ll see AI-powered features in Search that distill complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats, so you can quickly understand the big picture and learn more from the web: whether that’s seeking out additional perspectives, like blogs from people who play both piano and guitar, or going deeper on a related topic, like steps to get started as a beginner,” wrote CEO Sundar Pichai.

The company gave an example of using Bard to simplify complex topics, like explaining new discoveries from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old.

The product tests come after a recent all-hands meeting where employees raised concerns about the company’s competitive edge in AI, given the sudden popularity of ChatGPT.

CNBC reported that Google’s AI chief, Jeff Dean, told employees at the time that the company has much more “reputational risk” in providing wrong information and thus is moving “more conservatively than a small startup.” However, he and Pichai teased at the time that Google may launch similar products to the public sometime this year.

Google’s prime business is web search, and the company has long touted itself as a pioneer in AI. Leaders have been asking more employees for feedback on the efforts in recent weeks.

The company emphasized Monday that it will need rigorous testing, saying “we’ll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard’s responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information.”",stocks,GOOGL,"Google announces Bard A.I. in response to ChatGPT Google blog post: Google on Monday announced an artificial intelligence chatbot technology called Bard that the company will begin rolling out in the coming weeks.

Google is down almost 20 percent from ATH and has entered bear market territory. my thesis,"Google as the title states has gone down 20 percent from the ATH which is more than other big tech companies have seen. and is now in bear market territory. 

First let's start with the balance sheet of Google which is pretty good for the most part.  Google revenue has increased at a rate of 18.16 percent a year which is extremely fast top-line growth.  Free cash flow growth has been good but more and more is going towards capx while google tries to improve their LLM.  The free cash flow is also further hurt by their stock-based comp which last year counted for nearly 32 percent of all free cash flow. EPS is going up at a rate of 21 percent in the last 5 years which is being accelerated by google buying back shares.  They have minimal debt and lots of cash. they  have recently issued a dividend which is great because it returns more profits back to shareholders.

***Why is google trading down so much***

Google has recently found itself to be a convicted monopoly by the DOJ and is also seeing regulation from the EU as well in other anti monopoly lawsuits.  This has increased the level of uncertainty in the stock because the punishments have yet to be given leaving investors in limbo of how detrimental this could actually be.

Google as well as other big tech companies have been spending ungodly amounts of money chasing AI and while I do think AI could prove to be a worthwhile investment in the future in the short term this is causing companies like Google to not be as capital efficient as they once were.

***What will cause google stock to go up***

The thesis is simple...  Once time passes and we get past these anti-trust lawsuits the future from Google will seem more clear and this will help with investor sentiment and certainty and help contribute to an increase in stock price.  Google is currently spending money on a upgrade cycle which is AI.  Once the boom for AI starts to go down, capex spending should move down, allowing Google to return to a more capital efficient business model.  Also keep in mind that Google owns so many entities (YouTube, Google Cloud, Google Search, -google office suite, and android).

TLDR: Google stock is probably undervalued and its probably gonna go up lmao

Google Loses DOJ Antitrust Suit Over Search,"Google’s payments to make its search engine the default on smartphone web browsers violates US antitrust law, a federal judge ruled Monday, handing a key victory to the Justice Department.

Judge Amit Mehta in Washington said that the Alphabet Inc. unit’s $26 billion in payments effectively blocked any other competitor from succeeding in the market.

Antitrust enforcers alleged that Google has illegally maintained a monopoly over online search and related advertising. The government said that Google has paid Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and others billions over decades for prime placement on smartphones and web browsers. This default position has allowed Google to build up the most-used search engine in the world, and fueled more than $300 billion in annual revenue largely generated by search ads.

The case is the first antitrust trial pitting the federal government against a US technology company in more than two decades.

Bloomberg: US Says It’s Weighing Google Breakup as Monopoly Case Remedy,"The US Justice Department told a federal judge it is considering recommending that Google be forced to sell off parts of its operations to alleviate the harm caused by its monopolization of the online search market, in what would be a historic antitrust breakup.

In a court filing Tuesday, antitrust enforcers said Judge Amit Mehta could also force the Alphabet Inc. unit to provide access to the underlying data it uses to build its search results and artificial intelligence products.

The Justice Department “is considering behavioral and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search and Google search-related products and features — including emerging search access points and features, such as artificial intelligence — over rivals or new entrants,” the agency said in the filing.

The filing represents Washington’s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. The 32-page filing lays outs a framework of potential options for the judge to consider as the case moves to the remedy phase.

Antitrust enforcers said Google gained scale and data benefits from its illegal distribution agreements with other tech companies that made make its search engine the default option on smartphones and web browsers.

Mehta, who ruled this summer that Google broke antitrust laws in both online search and search text ads markets, plans to hold a trial on the proposed remedy next spring and issue a decision by August 2025. Google has already said it plans to appeal Mehta’s decision, but must wait until he finalizes a remedy before doing so.

Google’s Android business encompasses the operating system used on smartphones and devices as well as apps.

On Monday, a different federal judge ordered Google to open up its app store for the next three years to resolve a separate antitrust case related to its dominance of app distribution on Android smartphones. The company also plans to appeal that decision.

Amazon passed Google as 4th largest in S&P 500,"“Amazon stock was rising on Tuesday, just enough to maintain its place as the S&P 500’s fourth-largest company by market value after overtaking Alphabet on Monday. It may owe Oracle a little bit of a thank you.

Shares of Amazon.com were up 2.6% at 2:09 p.m. on Monday, after rising 2.3% on Monday. With Monday’s move, Amazon passed Alphabet as the fourth-largest company in the U.S. for the first time since April 5. Alphabet’s stock has fallen 8.7% in September, while Amazon is off just 0.7%. Amazon’s market cap was $22 billion more than Alphabet’s at Monday’s close, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Amazon had some good news for investors at an investor conference, noting that its cloud business, AWS, is gaining further traction in AI but that it’s also focused on “balancing expenditures with revenue growth,” according to BofA analyst Justin Post.

There was also good news from Oracle’s earnings. Yes, most of the good news was for Oracle stock, which has risen 12% on Thursday. But with the release of its earnings, Oracle and AWS said that they had come together with a new cloud product, Oracle Database@AWS. Oracle already has partnerships with Microsoft’s Azure and Google, but Post notes that the AWS/Oracle deal should be good for both companies. “Oracle & AMZN had been competitive for database customers, so new partnership suggests companies have a lot to gain by working together,” he writes.

Google CEO defends job cuts in animated town hall as employees demand clarity on process,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/23/google-ceo-defends-layoff-process-in-heated-town-hall-monday.html

Pichai said he consulted with the founders and controlling shareholders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, as well as the board of directors.

Pichai said 2021 marked “one of the strongest years we’ve ever had in the history of the company,” with 41% revenue growth. Google increased head count to match that expansion, and Pichai said the company was assuming growth would persist.

“In that context, we made a set of decisions that might have been right if the trends continued,” he said. “You have to remember if the trend had continued and we had not hired to keep pace, we would fall behind in many areas as a company.”

Executives said 750 senior leaders were involved in the process, adding it took a few weeks to determine who would be laid off.

“We have over 30,000 managers at Google and to consult with all of them would have made this an open process where it would have taken additional weeks or even months to come to a decision,” said Fiona Cicconi, Google’s chief people officer, at the meeting. “We wanted to get certainty sooner.”

Regarding the criteria for cuts, Cicconi said execs looked at areas where the work was necessary, but the company had too many people as well as places where the work itself wasn’t critical. Cicconi said the company considered “skill set, time in role where experience or relationships are relevant and matter, productivity indicators like sales quotas and performance history.”

Pichai indicated there would be executive compensation cuts but provided limited details. He said all senior vice presidents “will see a very significant reduction in their annual bonus” this year.

“The more senior you are, the more your compensation is tied to performance,” he said. “You can reduce your equity grants if performance is not great.”

Before the job cuts, Google had made the decision to pay out 80% of bonuses this month with the rest expected in March or April.

"Google, Meta, and others will have to explain their algorithms under new EU legislation","https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/23/23036976/eu-digital-services-act-finalized-algorithms-targeted-advertising

The EU has agreed on another ambitious piece of legislation to police the online world.

Early Saturday morning after hours of negotiations, the bloc agreed on the broad terms of the Digital Services Act, or DSA, which will force tech companies to take greater responsibility for content that appears on their platforms. New obligations include removing illegal content and goods more quickly, explaining to users and researchers how their algorithms work, and taking stricter action on the spread of misinformation. Companies face fines of up to six percent of their annual turnover for non-compliance.

Although the legislation only applies to EU citizens, the effect of these laws will certainly be felt in other parts of the world, too. Global tech companies may decide it is more cost-effective to implement a single strategy to police content and take the EU’s comparatively stringent regulations as their benchmark. While lawmakers in the US keen to rein in Big Tech with their own regulations have already begun looking to the EU’s rules for inspiration.

The final text of the DSA has yet to be released, but the European Parliament and European Commission have detailed a number of obligations it will contain:

* Targeted advertising based on an individuals’ religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity is banned. Minors cannot be subject to targeted advertising either.

* “Dark patterns” — confusing or deceptive user interfaces designed to steer users into making certain choices — will be prohibited. The EU says that, as a rule, cancelling subscriptions should be as easy as signing up for them.

* Large online platforms like Facebook will have to make the working of their recommender algorithms (e.g. used for sorting content on the News Feed or suggesting TV shows on Netflix) transparent to users. Users should also be offered a recommender system “not based on profiling.” In the case of Instagram, for example, this would mean a chronological feed (as it introduced recently).

* Hosting services and online platforms will have to explain clearly why they have removed illegal content, as well as give users the ability to appeal such takedowns. The DSA itself does not define what content is illegal, though, and leaves this up to individual countries.

* The largest online platforms will have to provide key data to researchers to “provide more insight into how online risks evolve.”

* Online marketplaces must keep basic information about traders on their platform to track down individuals selling illegal goods or services.

* Large platforms will also have to introduce new strategies for dealing with misinformation during crises (a provision inspired by the recent invasion of Ukraine).

The DSA will, like the DMA, distinguish between tech companies of different sizes, placing greater obligations on bigger companies. The largest firm — those with at least 45 million users in the EU, like Meta and Google — will face the most scrutiny. These tech companies have lobbied hard to water down the requirements in the DSA, particularly those concerning targeted advertising and handing over data to outside researchers.

Although the broad terms of the DSA have now been agreed upon by the member states of the EU, the legal language still needs to be finalized and the act officially voted into law. This last step is seen as a formality at this point, though. The rules will apply to all companies 15 months after the act is voted into law, or from 1 January 2024, whichever is later.",stocks,GOOGL,"Google, Meta, and others will have to explain their algorithms under new EU legislation The EU has agreed on another ambitious piece of legislation to police the online world.

Ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt sees Nvidia as big AI winner: ‘You know what to do in the stock market’,"I'm not looking for another debate about whether Nvidia deserves its valuation -- we've had tons of threads about that already. What I'm curious about is:

* What is your opinion of Eric Schmidt? Is he generally a trustworthy industry insider? Do you trust his opinions on this matter? (I looked for his name on this sub and it's rarely mentioned).

* If you don't trust him, what might be his motives for these comments? For example, is it perhaps to indirectly pump up his own Alphabet stock, which is probably #2 behind Nvidia and will benefit from big AI wave. (He owns 147 million shares)

Here's [link to the article](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/15/eric-schmidt-on-nvidia-you-know-what-to-do-in-the-stock-market.html) with some juicy bits:

* “I’m talking to the big companies, and the big companies are telling me they need $20 billion, $50 billion, $100 billion — very very hard,” said Schmidt, adding that he’s a “close friend” to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

* “If $300 billion is all going to Nvidia, you know what to do in the stock market,” Schmidt said. “That’s not a stock recommendation.” Schmidt didn’t say if he owns Nvidia shares.

* Schmidt, who was CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011 and remained on the board until 2019, was addressing a class of undergraduates on the topic of AI. He told the Wall Street Journal that he requested the video to be taken down because he had misspoken about Google’s lax work culture in the session.

* Schmidt suggested Nvidia won’t be the only winner in AI, but there aren’t a lot of other obvious choices. He said that he currently believes big companies who can invest more money into Nvidia chips and data centers will gain a technological lead over smaller competitors that can’t spend as freely.

* “At the moment, the gap between the frontier models — there are only three — and everyone else appears to be getting larger,” Schmidt said. “Six months ago, I was convinced that the gap was getting smaller, so I invested lots of money in the little companies. Now I’m not so sure.”

* Schmidt said it will be difficult for competitors to catch up with Nvidia because many of the most important open source tools that AI developers use are based on the company’s CUDA programming language. He said AMD’s software that translates Nvidia’s CUDA code for its own chips “doesn’t work yet.”

* Schmidt, who started venture firm Innovation Endeavors in 2010, still holds about 147 million shares of Alphabet, according to Bloomberg, valued at about $24 billion.

But Google is a great business for a good price. Above content quoted from: *Google Is The Most-Hated Tech Stock On Wall Street - Time To Buy*",0.24284941249226963,1

A leaked document from Google shows they believe Wall Street is too bullish on Microsoft’s Azure business,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/21/google-leaked-doc-microsoft-azure-losing-money-on-29-bln-in-revenue.html

Google has for years been playing catch-up in the cloud infrastructure market, where it’s seen in the industry as a distant third in the U.S., behind Amazon and Microsoft. The challenge for investors is that the three companies don’t report cloud infrastructure metrics in a way that makes them easily comparable. However, an internal estimate assembled by Google employees, based on a leaked Microsoft document and some extrapolation of other market statistics, suggests Google believes it’s closer to second place than analysts think.

Google’s document estimates that Microsoft generated under $29 billion in Azure consumption revenue in the latest fiscal year, which ended June 30, reflecting the value of cloud infrastructure services used by clients. That’s several billion dollars less than what Wall Street analysts had forecast. Bank of America was the most bullish, predicting Azure would pull in $37.5 billion in fiscal 2022. Cowen predicted revenue of $33.9 billion and UBS said $32.3 billion. The document from Google has Azure ending the 2022 fiscal year with an operating loss of almost $3 billion, down from a loss of more than $5 billion the prior year. It claims that Azure’s sales and marketing costs approached $10 billion, accounting for 34% of consumption revenue. Microsoft said sales and marketing costs for the whole company equaled 11% of revenue over the same period.

One analyst dismissed Google’s bottom-line tally. “There’s no way it’s that big of a loss,” said Derrick Wood, an analyst at Cowen who has the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft stock. His research shows Azure boasting an operating margin above 30%, compared with Google’s estimate of a -10% margin. According to data from Gartner, AWS controlled 39% of the global cloud infrastructure market in 2021, followed by Microsoft at 21%, China’s Alibaba at 9.5% and Google at 7.1%.",stocks,GOOGL,"A leaked document from Google shows they believe Wall Street is too bullish on Microsoft’s Azure business Google has for years been playing catch-up in the cloud infrastructure market, where it’s seen in the industry as a distant third in the U.S., behind Amazon and Microsoft.

"Google reportedly in advanced talks to acquire cyber startup Wiz for $23 billion, its largest-ever deal","https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/14/google-wiz-cybersecurity-deal-largest-ever.html

Google is in advanced talks to acquire cybersecurity firm Wiz for $23 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. The people familiar told the Journal that a deal could come soon. Wiz was founded in 2020, and has grown at a rapid clip under CEO Assaf Rappaport. It had been eyeing an IPO as recently as May, when the company achieved a valuation of $12 billion.

Wiz’s cloud security offering gives executives and cybersecurity professionals insight into the company’s full cloud presence, something appealing to large firms with significant computing resources. It is backed by a roster of blue chip firms, including Israeli VC firm Cyberstarts, Index Ventures, Insight Partners and Sequoia Capital.

If completed, the deal would be Google’s largest ever acquisition. It would also underline a clear and continued bet on cybersecurity, at a time when nation state and criminal actors have managed to disrupt governments and large organizations. Google has made large cyber acquisitions before: The company acquired cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion two years ago. But the company now faces unprecedented levels of antitrust scrutiny. The Justice Department has sued Google twice on antitrust grounds. The company’s acquisition practices were highlighted in the most recent litigation, filed in 2023.

Epic Games wins antitrust lawsuit against Google,"
SAN FRANCISCO — Epic Games won an antitrust lawsuit against Google on Monday, in a landmark decision where a jury found Google broke competition laws in how it ran its app store.

The decision is a major blow to the tech giant and the concept that Big Tech companies should have complete control over how pricing and payments are done on their massive internet platforms. It could open up other challenges to how large tech companies govern their marketplaces, potentially forcing them to allow alternate payment processors. That could cut into revenue for Google and other companies like Apple and Amazon, which make money by charging fees on any transactions on their platforms.

In summer 2020, Epic had revolted against Apple and Google’s payment-sharing systems for app developers. Epic tweaked its popular Fortnite app so users could pay the company directly. First Apple, then Google, booted Fortnite from their app stores for violating terms. Epic sued both companies, arguing the rules violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.

Apple's Popularity With Gen Z Poses Challenges for Google/Android," Younger Americans prefer Apple over rival companies by significant margins, driving a generational shift toward Apple devices and social pressure, the [*Financial Times*](https://www.ft.com/content/8a2e8442-449e-4dbd-bd6d-2656b4503526) reports. 

 

According to the report, younger consumers are concerned about being socially ostracised for not having an [iPhone](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/) – a phenomenon that is driving young people to buy other Apple products and services, leading to growing market share across multiple product categories.

Those born after 1996, also known as Gen Z, compose 34 percent of all ‌iPhone‌ owners in the U.S., compared to just 10 percent for Samsung. For older generations, there is a relatively even split between ‌iPhone‌ and Android users. The ramifications of this shift toward Apple devices among younger people extends beyond iPhones, with these users being much more likely to purchase AirPods, Apple Watches, and Macs.

For every 100 iPhones Apple sells around the world, it also sells 26 iPads, 17 Apple Watches, and 35 pairs of AirPods, according to research by Canalys. For Samsung, every 100 smartphone sales leads to fewer than 11 tablets, six smartwatches, and six pairs of wireless earbuds being sold. This is in spite of the fact that the average selling price of an ‌iPhone‌ is almost three times that of an Android device.

Researchers who advise companies about the preferences of Gen Z consumers told the *Financial Times* that these customers are the most online of any age group, spending up to six hours a day on their smartphones. As a result, Apple's ecosystem is shaping social decision-making, with particular emphasis on the importance of iMessage as a social signal, necessitated by inferior experiences messaging and using group chats via SMS.

In Europe, where iMessage is less prevalent and Android has a bigger market share, the same trend is similarly visible. Canalys research indicates that 83 percent of Apple users in western Europe under 25 years old plan to keep using an ‌iPhone‌. As Gen Z gets older, this trend is likely to grow and further entrench Apple's market share, making it increasingly difficult for rival companies to capture new customers and make inroads.",stocks,GOOGL,"Apple's Popularity With Gen Z Poses Challenges for Google/Android Younger Americans prefer Apple over rival companies by significant margins, driving a generational shift toward Apple devices and social pressure, the [*Financial Times*]( reports.

It’s ‘really the Google web’: Microsoft CEO testifies about how hard it is to break into search during antitrust trial,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/02/microsoft-ceo-testifies-about-competing-with-google-in-antitrust-trial.html

When it comes to online search, it’s Google’s web and everyone else is playing in it, according to rival Microsoft. That was the essence of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s testimony in federal court on Monday as part of the government’s antitrust trial against Google. Nadella told the court that Google’s dominant market share in online search means that publishers and advertisers shape their content to Google’s requirements, making it harder for competitors like Microsoft’s Bing to gain a foothold.

“Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web,” Nadella said from the stand in Washington, D.C., District Court. Nadella was referring to the way publishers often cater their content and advertising to Google’s products, like by optimizing their pages for how Google ranks search results. Nadella was questioned by lawyers for the Department of Justice and a coalition of state attorneys general who are suing Google for allegedly violating antitrust laws by illegally maintaining a monopoly in the general search market. The government argues that Google locked up distribution channels for general search engines through exclusive deals with browser and phone makers to be the default choice on various devices. Perhaps the most famous of those deals is the multibillion-dollar agreement between Google and Apple to make Google search the default on Apple products like the iPhone.

The government has tried to make the case that Google’s dominance, aided by these exclusive deals, creates a flywheel effect, where greater exposure to users leads to more data to make Google’s search results better and attracts more advertisers to the product. That, in turn, generates more revenue that can be used to fund these massive distribution deals. Meanwhile, the government argues, it becomes even harder for rivals to breakthrough to consumers, and as a result, they miss out on the opportunity for greater benefits or innovations in search. Nadella affirmed that argument in his testimony Monday, describing the obstacles a general search competitor like Bing faces to gain more market share from Google.",stocks,GOOGL,"It’s ‘really the Google web’: Microsoft CEO testifies about how hard it is to break into search during antitrust trial When it comes to online search, it’s Google’s web and everyone else is playing in it, according to rival Microsoft.

The ending of Google's monopoly trial has Silicon Valley on edge,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-ending-of-googles-monopoly-trial-has-silicon-valley-on-edge-113835464.html

>A landmark antitrust case pitting Google (GOOG, GOOGL) against the Justice Department entered its final stage this past week as prosecutors from the federal government and 14 states said in their closing arguments that Google illegally monopolized the online search and search advertising markets.

>A government win would certainly threaten a giant piece of Google’s $237.8 billion profit engine. But the outcome, which will be decided by US District Judge Amit Mehta in the weeks or months to come, also has giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world.

>That's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims, and because all three stand to lose or gain depending on the outcome.

>The government argues Google is violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act by blocking competitors from entering three distinct markets: general online search, search advertising, and search text advertising.

>A government win would put at risk the billions of dollars in mutually lucrative contracts between Google and Apple, as well as deals with other device manufacturers and telecom companies.

> The government alleged in its case that Google pays billions of dollars each year to LG, Motorola (MSI), and Samsung; major US wireless carriers such as AT&T (T), T-Mobile (TMUS), and Verizon (VZ); and browser developers such as Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb.

Google is a better long term hold than Microsoft.,"This is anecdotal. I’m stupid so take it with a grain of salt.

I work in IT in public education. Hence I’m stupid and can’t do anything else more promising in tech. 

Think about your first interactions with a computer. Word processing maybe? Kids are not using Word these days, like at all. Maybe you first word processed with Word. Maybe you grew up with Office products. This generation isn’t. 

Edit: They’re not using PowerPoint, they’re using Slides. They’re not using Excel, they’re using Sheets. They’re not using Outlook, they’re using Gmail. They’re not using Microsoft Teams, they’re using Zoom, and then in 2nd for video conferencing they’re using Google Meet. Office isn’t necessarily Microsoft’s primary business, but the battle between Microsoft and Google is a battle for mass adoption. And Google right now is planting seeds to have an iron grip on Gen Z when they enter the private sector later on. Microsoft will have to fight to hold market share and I reckon they’ll lose vs Google long term. The game is a fight for mass adoption, and there’s numerous ways to monetize mass adoption. Want a cheap Windows computer that’s sub $300? They absolutely suck, they’re terrible. Want a Chromebook that’s sub $300? They’re decent, snappy useable machines. Look to the developing world. As network infrastructure improves, cheap web based Chromebooks will continue to be a hit among low income consumers in developing nations. Who’s better positioned to scale as the world gets more and more connected? My vote is for Google.

Google is the most evil company in the world. And as the evil geniuses they are, they’re thinking decades ahead. They know that their long term future depends on kids getting hooked on their products, so that when they’re leaders of companies in the future, their company is powered by Google Workspace and not Office. Google beat Microsoft and Apple in the education market. ChromeOS now has more market share than MacOS. Kids are doing all of their productivity tasks in the Google ecosystem. Remember back in 2016/17 when you might have said to yourself, “why do all these kids want to be Youtubers when they grow up?” I know why this happened. I’ve seen the district dashboard data. YouTube is the #1 site kids use on their school issued Chromebook.

Edit: You might say to yourself, Apple won the education market in the 80s/90s, but the enterprise market is still driven by Microsoft. Back then there were like 10 Macs in a lab for 500 kids to share. What Google has accomplished is way more impactful. Literally every kid 1 to 1 in public schools now has a Chromebook in their backpack. This is much more groundbreaking than what Apple did and will help Google retain a generation’s worth of customers as they age into adulthood.

Office products will do well for the next 20 years in enterprise settings. And then all of the sudden Google Workspace will be king in enterprise. Why? Because they planted the seeds and won the public education market and brainwashed millions of kids.

$GOOGL Google is in a big trouble in the long run - here is why,"Let's do the math directly and take a look at Google ads results in 2023:

- The revenue generated by Google ads in 2023 is $237 billion.

- The revenue portion from Google search engine is around 60%!!! That means out of the $237 billion, around $142 billion revenue is generated from the search engine or search ads.

- Google's total revenue for 2023 was $305 billion, that means the revenue from the search engine only (not entire Google ads) makes around 45% of Google's total revenue.

Now the second search engine behind Google is Microsoft Bing, Microsoft generated in 2023 only $12 Billion from Bing ads.

Google by far is the dominant as for now, and Microsoft although in the second place behind them, won't be able to reach even a quarter of Google's revenue, they had many failed attempts to promote Bing.

Now some of you probably heared about the upcoming releases of SearchGPT, whoever tried ChatGPT will know it's by far better than Gemini and the other AI models, if Openai released their SearchGPT and people switched from Google search to SearchGPT (which I personally think will happen), Google in this case will keep 45% of its total revenue vulnerable by SearchGPT.

TL;DR Google have strong exposure to its search engine, the revenue generated from the search engine is around 45% of its total revenue, with the upcoming release of SearchGPT, Google may lose its dominance in the long term which may cause their revenue growth to stop or decline.

Bloomberg: US Considers a Rare Antitrust Move: Breaking Up Google,"A rare bid to break up Alphabet Inc.’s Google is one of the options being considered by the Justice Department after a landmark court ruling found that the company monopolized the online search market, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations.

The move would be Washington’s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Less severe options include forcing Google to share more data with competitors and measures to prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage in AI products, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations.

Regardless, the government will likely seek a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of its case against Google. If the Justice Department pushes ahead with a breakup plan, the most likely units for divestment are the Android operating system and Google’s web browser Chrome, said the people. Officials are also looking at trying to force a possible sale of AdWords, the platform the company uses to sell text advertising, one of the people said.

The Justice Department discussions have intensified in the wake of Judge Amit Mehta’s Aug. 5 ruling that Google illegally monopolized the markets of online search and search text ads. Google has said it will appeal that decision, but Mehta has ordered both sides to begin plans for the second phase of the case, which will involve the government’s proposals for restoring competition, including a possible breakup request.

Alphabet shares fell as much as 2.5% to $160.11 in after-hours trading before erasing some losses.

A Google spokesman declined to comment on the possible remedy. A Justice Department spokeswoman also declined to comment.

The US plan will need to be accepted by Mehta, who would direct the company to comply. A forced breakup of Google would be the biggest of a US company since AT&T was dismantled in the 1980s.

Justice Department attorneys, who have been consulting with companies affected by Google’s practices, have raised concerns in their discussions that the company’s search dominance gives it advantages in developing artificial intelligence technology, the people said. As part of a remedy, the government might seek to stop the company from forcing websites to allow their content to be used for some of Google’s AI products in order to appear in search results.

**Breakup**

Divesting the Android operating system, used on about 2.5 billion devices worldwide, is one of the remedies that’s been most frequently discussed by Justice Department attorneys, according to the people. In his decision, Mehta found that Google requires device makers to sign agreements to gain access to its apps like Gmail and the Google Play Store.

Those agreements also require that Google’s search widget and Chrome browser be installed on devices in such a way they can’t be deleted, effectively preventing other search engines from competing, he found.

Mehta’s decision follows a verdict by a California jury in December that found the company monopolized Android app distribution. A judge in that case hasn’t yet decided on relief. The Federal Trade Commission, which also enforces antitrust laws, filed a brief in that case this week and said in a statement that Google shouldn’t be allowed “to reap the rewards of illegal monopolization.”

Google paid as much as $26 billion to companies to make its search engine the default on devices and in web browsers, with $20 billion of that going to Apple Inc.

Mehta’s ruling also found Google monopolized the advertisements that appear at the top of a search results page to draw users to websites, known as search text ads. Those are sold via Google Ads, which was rebranded from AdWords in 2018 and offers marketers a way to run ads against certain search keywords related to their business. About two-thirds of Google’s total revenue comes from search ads, amounting to more than $100 billion in 2020, according to testimony from last year’s trial.

If the Justice Department doesn’t call for Google to sell off AdWords, it could ask for interoperability requirements that would make it work seamlessly on other search engines, the people said.

**Data Access**

Another option would require Google to divest or license its data to rivals, such as Microsoft’s Bing or DuckDuckGo. Mehta’s ruling found that Google’s contracts ensure not only that its search engine gets the most user data – 16 times as much as its next closest competitor — but that data stream also keeps its rivals from improving their search results and competing effectively.

Europe’s recently enacted digital gatekeeper rules imposed a similar requirement that Google make available some of its data to third-party search engines. The company has said publicly that sharing data can pose user privacy concerns, so it only makes available information on searches that meet certain thresholds.

Requiring monopolists to allow rivals to have some access to technology has been a remedy in previous cases. In the Justice Department’s first case against AT&T in 1956, the company was required to provide royalty-free licenses to its patents.

In the antitrust case against Microsoft, the settlement required the Redmond, Washington, tech giant to make some of its so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, available to third-parties for free. APIs are used to ensure that software programs can effectively communicate and exchange data with each other.

**AI Products**

For years, websites have allowed Google’s web crawler access to ensure they appear in the company’s search results. But more recently some of that data has been used to help Google develop its AI.

Last fall, Google created a tool to allow websites to block scraping for AI, after companies complained. But that opt-out doesn’t apply to everything. In May, Google announced that some searches will now come with “AI Overviews,” narrative responses that spare people the task of clicking through various links. The AI-powered panel appears underneath queries, presenting summarized information drawn from Google search results from across the web.

Google doesn’t allow website publishers to opt-out of appearing in AI Overviews, since those are a “feature” of search, not a separate product. Websites can block Google from using snippets, but that applies to both search and the AI Overviews.

While AI Overviews only appear on a fraction of searches, the feature’s roll-out has been rocky after some excerpts offered embarrassing suggestions, like advising people to eat rocks or to put glue on pizza.

"AI Wars: Google stock tumbles -5% premarket as Bard AI gives wrong answer at launch event, Microsoft to incorporate ChatGPT into Bing"," Google’s new AI-powered chatbot Bard has stumbled at the first hurdle after it gave a misleading response during a demonstration at a launch event this week.

The AI search assistant, unveiled on Tuesday, is used by Google to generate text summaries of search results.

Yet in an animated image of Google Bard in action distributed by Google to mark the new feature’s launch, it gives a wrong answer.

The falsehood will raise further questions about the accuracy of search engines and of AI-generated answers to humans’ questions.

In an animated GIF showing how Bard works, a user types in the search query ""what new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my 9 year old about?""

The NASA telescope was made operational in December 2021 and has been used by scientists to make several discoveries of new planets outside the Solar System.

One of the responses generated by Bard says: ""JWST took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system.""

Yet this is not accurate. The first picture ever taken of a planet outside the solar system - an exoplanet - was captured in 2004 by the Very Large Telescope array in Chile.

I think Alphabet (GOOGL) is the most undervalued stock in the stock market right now,"I am 100% invested in Alphabet due to several reasons. I think we are in a similar situation to Meta when it was faced with law suits, reached 90$ last year and everybody said it would die. 

1. Alphabet is growing in the double digits every year since its inception. Its PE is on the way to below 20 and laughably cheap for a tech company with that growth. 

3. They crushed earnings and the only reason for their slump afterwards was their heavy AI spending, which they can easily cut if they see its not worth it anymore. Also comparable to Meta.

2. Alphabet is a leader in innovative technologies such as autonomous driving. Tesla shot up 40% or something when Elon made another promise towards autonomous driving, while Google actually is the first mover and build up a network with hundred thousands of paying users. 

3. I dont think that AI will be as useful as some still expect. But in no way Google is endangered by that. I dont have more recent numbers, but in July Googles market share in the search business grew slightly, while ChatGPT declined by 12%. I think the summarised answers in Google search are already way more useful and convenient than what Bing or ChatGPT offers. 

4. If AI presents itself as useful Google and Meta will have the best model. People misunderstand how AI works. Its not the model which is important, its the underlying set of data. With the deal it closed with Reddit beginning of 2024, google honestly struck Gold for a really cheap price.

5. Tech companies are literally what keeps the american economy and influence in the world right now alive. I think its not realistic to think that the DOJ will do anything which substancially weakens an american tech company at this point. They will probably get a slap on the wrist in a way of a (big) fine. But priced in is currently a potential break up.

6. Atleast for the next earnings I expect an ad revenue ""short squeeze"" because of the really polarized american election. Way more money will be invested in ads than in previous elections, and while the sum on its own isnt that much, depending on how elastic the ad market is, it will drive up ad space for everyone involved.",stocks,Google,"I think Alphabet (GOOGL) is the most undervalued stock in the stock market right now I am 100% invested in Alphabet due to several reasons.

Apparently that's a $20decillion, fine.

  
Google banned the ultra-nationalist Tsargrad channel from YouTube in 2020, in response to US sanctions imposed against its owner, but after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 more channels were added to the banned list. 

The court imposed a 100,000 rubles per day, equivalent to about $1,025, with the total fine doubling every week. Thanks to the compound interest Google has now racked up a fine which the Russian judge on Monday called ‘a case in which there are many, many zeroes’. There are so many zeroes, in fact that the total fine amount completely dwarfs global GDP, which the World Bank estimates at about $100trillion.

In its most recent earnings statement, it said: ‘We have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. ‘For example, civil judgments that include compounding penalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.

"Wiz walks away from $23 billion deal with Google, will pursue IPO ","Wiz has walked away from a $23 billion deal to be acquired by Google, in what would have been the search giant’s largest ever deal, telling employees it would pursue an initial public offering as it initially planned.

“Saying no to such humbling offers is tough,” Wiz co-founder Assaf Rappaport said in a memo obtained by CNBC to the company’s worldwide employee base.

The deal would have nearly doubled the $12 billion valuation of the startup from its most recent round of funding. Wiz was founded in 2020 and has grown at a rapid speed under Rappaport, who had been eyeing an IPO as recently as May. A person familiar with the company’s thinking cited both antitrust and investor concerns as part of the motivation behind the decision to walk away.

Wiz’s cloud security products include prevention, active detection and response — a range that has appealed to large firms and would have helped Google compete with Microsoft which also sells security software.

CNBC reported in July on the talks between Google and Wiz.

The company reportedly hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue after 18 months, and achieved $350 million in annual recurring revenue in 2023. It’s backed by a roster of blue-chip firms, including Israeli venture capitalist Cyberstarts, Index Ventures, Insight Partners and Sequoia Capital.

Google successfully acquired cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion in 2022. Google’s largest deal remains the acquisition of hardware maker Motorola in 2012 for $12.5 billion, which it ended up selling to Lenovo for $2.9 billion in 2014. As recently as last week, Google reportedly ended conversations to acquire sales software maker HubSpot.

 (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.’s Bing may replace Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search service on Samsung Electronics Co. devices, according to a New York Times report on Sunday. 

Suwon-based Samsung, the world’s leading smartphone maker, is considering making the switch, putting at risk roughly $3 billion in annual revenue for Google, the report said. Bing’s threat to Google’s search dominance has grown more credible in recent months with the addition of OpenAI’s technology to provide ChatGPT-like responses to user queries.

Samsung shipped 261 million smartphones in 2022, according to IDC data, all running Google’s Android software. The Korean company has long-established partnerships with both Microsoft and Google, and its devices come preloaded with a library of apps and services from both, such as OneDrive and Google Maps. Negotiations are still ongoing and Samsung may yet decide to keep Google as its default provider, according to the report.

"Google Cutting 12,000 Jobs in 6% Slash to Global Workforce","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-20/google-cutting-12-000-jobs-in-6-slash-to-global-workforce

Google parent Alphabet Inc. said it will cut about 12,000 jobs, more than 6% of its global workforce, becoming the latest tech giant to retrench after years of abundant growth and hiring.

The cuts will affect jobs globally and across the entire company, Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai told employees in an email on Friday, writing that he takes “full responsibility for the decisions that led us here.”

With the layoffs, Google joins a host of other tech giants that have drastically scaled back operations amid a faltering global economy and soaring inflation. Meta Platforms Inc., Twitter Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have all slashed their ranks. Thanks to a resilient search business, Google has been one of the longest tech holdouts avoiding major workforce reductions. But the company is dealing with a slowdown in digital advertising and its cloud-computing division continues to trail Amazon and Microsoft Corp. 

“These are important moments to sharpen our focus, reengineer our cost base, and direct our talent and capital to our highest priorities,” Pichai wrote in the email. 

He said the company has a “substantial opportunity in front of us” with artificial intelligence, a key investment area where Google is facing a surge in recent competition. 

In October, the company reported earnings and revenue that missed analyst expectations. Profit declined 27% to $13.9 billion compared to the prior year. At the time, Pichai said Google would curb its expenses and Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said the number of new jobs would fall by more than half in the fourth quarter from the previous period.

Google’s reduction in headcount follows investor pressure to adopt a more aggressive strategy to curb spending. In November, TCI Fund Management Ltd. urged the internet search giant in an open letter to publicly set a target for profit margins, increase share buybacks and reduce losses in its portfolio of Other Bets, Alphabet’s moonshot division. “The company has too many employees and the cost per employee is too high,” TCI Managing Director Chris Hohn said, noting that Alphabet’s headcount had swelled 20% per year since 2017.

According to the human-resources consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., the most job cuts in 2022 were in the tech sector — 97,171 for the year, up 649% compared to the previous year.

Google has made a series of cost-cutting moves in recent months, canceling the next generation of its Pixelbook laptop and permanently shuttering Stadia, its cloud gaming service. Earlier in January, Verily, a biotech unit of Alphabet, said it was cutting 15% of its staff. 

Pichai said Alphabet would be paying affected employees 16 weeks of severance and six months worth of health benefits in the US, with other regions receiving packages based on local laws and practices.",stocks,Google,"Google Cutting 12,000 Jobs in 6% Slash to Global Workforce Google parent Alphabet Inc. said it will cut about 12,000 jobs, more than 6% of its global workforce, becoming the latest tech giant to retrench after years of abundant growth and hiring.

[Google](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_company=Google) shifted more than $75.4 billion (€63 billion) in profits out of the Republic using the controversial “double-Irish” tax arrangement in 2019, the last year in which it used the loophole.

The technology giant availed of the tax arrangement to move the money out of Google [Ireland](https://www.irishtimes.com/news) Holdings Unlimited Company via interim dividends and other payments. This company was incorporated in Ireland but tax domiciled in [Bermuda](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_location=Bermuda) at the time of the transfer.

The move allowed Google Ireland Holdings to escape corporation tax both in the Republic and in the [United States](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_location=United+States) where its ultimate parent, Alphabet, is headquartered. The holding company reported a $13 billion pretax profit for 2019, which was effectively tax-free, the accounts show.

A year earlier, Google Ireland Holdings paid out dividends of €23 billion, having recorded turnover of $25.7 billion.

Google has used the double Irish loophole to funnel billions in global profits through Ireland and on to Bermuda, effectively put them beyond the reach of US tax authorities.

Companies exploiting the double Irish put their intellectual property into an Irish-registered company that is controlled from a tax haven such as Bermuda. Ireland considers the company to be tax-resident in Bermuda, while the US considers it to be tax-resident here. The result is that when royalty payments are sent to the company, they go untaxed – unless or until the money is eventually sent home to the US parent.

The “double Irish” was abolished in 2015 for new companies establishing operations in the Republic. However, controversially, it allowed those already using it until the end of 2020 to phase it out.

Google overhauled its global tax structure and consolidated its intellectual property holdings back to the United States in early 2020, meaning 2019 was the final year in which it availed of the arrangement.

Up to late 2019, Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company was an intellectual property licensing company with turnover derived from the licensing of IP to subsidiaries. The accounts state it had no employees and that it was tax resident at the time in Bermuda, where the “standard rate tax is 0 per cent”.

Commenting on the movement of the profits out of its Irish unit, a spokeswoman for Google said: “In December 2019, in line with the OECD’s base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) conclusions and changes to US and Irish tax laws, we simplified our corporate structure and started licensing our IP from the US, not Bermuda. The accounts filed today cover the 2019 financial year, before we made those changes.

“Including all annual and one-time income taxes over the past ten years, our global effective tax rate has been over 20 per cent, with more than 80 per cent of that tax due in the US,” she added.

The accounts state that Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company became tax resident in Ireland from January 1st, 2021, and that it now just operates as a holding company.

Turnover for the holding company rose from $25.7 billion in 2018 to $26.5 billion in 2019. The increase was primarily due to a rise in turnover recorded by the company’s subsidiaries, which results in higher royalty payments.

Dividend income from shares in group undertakings jumped from just $2.9 million in 2018 to $597.5 million a year later. The accounts also show a $3 billion increase in research and development costs in 2019, with the company incurring R&D expenses of $10.4 billion under a cost-sharing agreement with other Google entities globally.

Google Ireland, the tech company’s main operating Irish subsidiary with over 4,000 employees, recorded €45.7 billion in revenues in 2019 with pretax profits amounting to €1.94 billion. It paid €263 million in tax that year, down nearly €9 million versus 2018.

It is estimated that US multinationals were holding more than a $1 trillion in profits offshore via mechanisms such as the double Irish and the so-called Dutch sandwich by the end of 2017. Tax cuts introduced by former US president [Donald Trump](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_person=Donald+Trump) in 2019 have led to some of those profits being repatriated to the United States.",stocks,Google,"Google uses ‘double-Irish’ to shift $75.4bn in profits out of Ireland [ &; [Google]( shifted more than $75.4 billion (€63 billion) in profits out of the Republic using the controversial “double-Irish” tax arrangement in 2019, the last year in which it used the loophole.

Google in Crisis,"https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/inside-the-crisis-at-google


It’s not like artificial intelligence caught Sundar Pichai off guard. I remember sitting in the audience in January 2018 when the Google CEO said it was as profound as electricity and fire. His proclamation stunned the San Francisco audience that day, so bullish it still seems a bit absurd, and it underscores how bizarre it is that his AI strategy now appears unmoored.

The latest AI crisis at Google — where its Gemini image and text generation tool produced insane responses, including portraying Nazis as people of color — is now spiraling into the worst moment of Pichai’s tenure. Morale at Google is plummeting, with one employee telling me it’s the worst he’s ever seen. And more people are calling for Pichai’s ouster than ever before. Even the relatively restrained Ben Thompson of Stratechery demanded his removal on Monday. 


Yet so much — too much — coverage of Google’s Gemini incident views it through the culture war lens. For many, Google either caved to wokeness or cowed to those who’d prefer not to address AI bias. These interpretations are wanting, and frankly incomplete explanations for why the crisis escalated to this point. The culture war narrative gives too much credit to Google for being a well organized, politics-driven machine. And the magnitude of the issue runs even deeper than Gemini’s skewed responses. 

There’s now little doubt that Google steered its users’ Gemini prompts by adding words that pushed the outputs toward diverse responses — forgetting when not to ask for diversity, like with the Nazis — but the way those added words got there is the real story. Even employees on Google’s Trust and Safety team are puzzled by where exactly the words came from, a product of Google scrambling to set up a Gemini unit without clear ownership of critical capabilities. And a reflection of the lack of accountability within some parts of Google.

""Organizationally at this place, it's impossible to navigate and understand who's in rooms and who owns things,” one member of Google’s Trust and Safety team told me. “Maybe that's by design so that nobody can ever get in trouble for failure.”

Organizational dysfunction is still common within Google, something it’s worked to fix through recent layoffs, and it showed up in the formation of its Gemini team. Moving fast while chasing OpenAI and Microsoft, Google gave its Product, Trust and Safety, and Responsible AI teams input into the training and release of Gemini. And their coordination clearly wasn’t good enough. In his letter to Google employees addressing the Gemini debacle this week, Pichai singled out “structural changes” as a remedy to prevent a repeat, acknowledging the failure.

Those structural changes may turn into a significant rework of how the organization operates. “The problem is big enough that replacing a single leader or merging just two teams probably won’t cut it,” the Google Trust and Safety employee said.

Already, Google is rushing to fix some of the deficiencies that contributed to the mess. On Friday, a ‘reset’ day Google, and through the weekend — when Google employees almost never work — the company’s Trust and Safety leadership called for volunteers to test Gemini’s outputs to prevent further blunders. “We need multiple volunteers on stand-by per time block so we can activate rapid adversarial testing on high priority topics,” one executive wrote in an internal email. 

And as the crisis brewed internally, it escalated externally when Google shared the same type of opaque public statements and pledges about doing better that have worked for its core products. That underestimated how different the public’s relationship is with generative AI than other technology, and made matters worse. 

Unlike search, which points you to the web, generative AI is the core experience, not a route elsewhere. Using a generative tool like Gemini is a tradeoff. You get the benefit of a seemingly-magical product. But you give up control. While you may get answers quickly, or a cool looking graphic, you lose touch with the source material. To use it means putting more trust in giant companies like Google, and to maintain that trust Google needs to be extremely transparent. Yet what do we really know about how its models operate? Continuing on as it if were business as usual, Google contributed to the magnitude of the crisis.

Now, some close to Google are starting to ask if it’s focused in the right places, coming back to Pichai’s strategic plan. Was it really necessary, for instance, for Google to build a $20 per month chatbot, when it could simply imbue its existing technology — including Gmail, Docs, and its Google Home smart speakers — with AI?

There are all worthwhile questions, and the open wondering about Pichai’s job is fair, but the current wave of Generative AI is still so early that Google has time to adjust. On Friday, for instance, Elon Musk sued OpenAI for betraying its founding agreement, a potential setback for the company’s main competitor.

Google, which just released a powerful Gemini 1.5 model, will have at least a few more shots until a true moment for panic sets in. But everyone within the company knows it can’t afford many more of the previous week’s incidents, from Pichai to the workers pulling shifts this weekend.

Google announces Bard A.I. in response to ChatGPT,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/06/google-announces-bard-ai-in-response-to-chatgpt.html

Google blog post: https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/

Google on Monday announced an artificial intelligence chatbot technology called Bard that the company will begin rolling out in the coming weeks. The announcement confirms CNBC’s prior reporting. Bard will compete directly with rival ChatGPT, an AI service created by OpenAI.

Bard is powered by the company’s large language model LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications. Google will open up the conversation technology to “trusted testers” ahead of making it more widely available to the public, the company said in a blog post Monday.

Last week, CNBC reported that Google is testing some of these features with employees as part of a “code red” plan to respond to ChatGPT, the popular chatbot backed in part by Microsoft. Features included a chatbot called “Apprentice Bard,” as well as new search desktop designs that could be used in a question-and-answer format.

“Soon, you’ll see AI-powered features in Search that distill complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats, so you can quickly understand the big picture and learn more from the web: whether that’s seeking out additional perspectives, like blogs from people who play both piano and guitar, or going deeper on a related topic, like steps to get started as a beginner,” wrote CEO Sundar Pichai.

The company gave an example of using Bard to simplify complex topics, like explaining new discoveries from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old.

The product tests come after a recent all-hands meeting where employees raised concerns about the company’s competitive edge in AI, given the sudden popularity of ChatGPT.

CNBC reported that Google’s AI chief, Jeff Dean, told employees at the time that the company has much more “reputational risk” in providing wrong information and thus is moving “more conservatively than a small startup.” However, he and Pichai teased at the time that Google may launch similar products to the public sometime this year.

Google’s prime business is web search, and the company has long touted itself as a pioneer in AI. Leaders have been asking more employees for feedback on the efforts in recent weeks.

The company emphasized Monday that it will need rigorous testing, saying “we’ll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard’s responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information.”",stocks,Google,"Google announces Bard A.I. in response to ChatGPT Google blog post: Google on Monday announced an artificial intelligence chatbot technology called Bard that the company will begin rolling out in the coming weeks.

Google is down almost 20 percent from ATH and has entered bear market territory. my thesis,"Google as the title states has gone down 20 percent from the ATH which is more than other big tech companies have seen. and is now in bear market territory. 

First let's start with the balance sheet of Google which is pretty good for the most part.  Google revenue has increased at a rate of 18.16 percent a year which is extremely fast top-line growth.  Free cash flow growth has been good but more and more is going towards capx while google tries to improve their LLM.  The free cash flow is also further hurt by their stock-based comp which last year counted for nearly 32 percent of all free cash flow. EPS is going up at a rate of 21 percent in the last 5 years which is being accelerated by google buying back shares.  They have minimal debt and lots of cash. they  have recently issued a dividend which is great because it returns more profits back to shareholders.

***Why is google trading down so much***

Google has recently found itself to be a convicted monopoly by the DOJ and is also seeing regulation from the EU as well in other anti monopoly lawsuits.  This has increased the level of uncertainty in the stock because the punishments have yet to be given leaving investors in limbo of how detrimental this could actually be.

Google as well as other big tech companies have been spending ungodly amounts of money chasing AI and while I do think AI could prove to be a worthwhile investment in the future in the short term this is causing companies like Google to not be as capital efficient as they once were.

***What will cause google stock to go up***

The thesis is simple...  Once time passes and we get past these anti-trust lawsuits the future from Google will seem more clear and this will help with investor sentiment and certainty and help contribute to an increase in stock price.  Google is currently spending money on a upgrade cycle which is AI.  Once the boom for AI starts to go down, capex spending should move down, allowing Google to return to a more capital efficient business model.  Also keep in mind that Google owns so many entities (YouTube, Google Cloud, Google Search, -google office suite, and android).

TLDR: Google stock is probably undervalued and its probably gonna go up lmao

Google Loses DOJ Antitrust Suit Over Search,"Google’s payments to make its search engine the default on smartphone web browsers violates US antitrust law, a federal judge ruled Monday, handing a key victory to the Justice Department.

Judge Amit Mehta in Washington said that the Alphabet Inc. unit’s $26 billion in payments effectively blocked any other competitor from succeeding in the market.

Antitrust enforcers alleged that Google has illegally maintained a monopoly over online search and related advertising. The government said that Google has paid Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and others billions over decades for prime placement on smartphones and web browsers. This default position has allowed Google to build up the most-used search engine in the world, and fueled more than $300 billion in annual revenue largely generated by search ads.

The case is the first antitrust trial pitting the federal government against a US technology company in more than two decades.

Google will face another antitrust trial September 9th, this time over ad tech. The company will face off in federal court against the US Department of Justice in Virginia, after the DOJ claimed in January 2023 that Google violated US antitrust law by illegally monopolizing the digital ads market, allegedly boosting its profits while raising costs for advertisers. Google has said the DOJ’s reasoning “would slow innovation, raise advertising fees and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow.”

The company will face off in federal court against the US Department of Justice in Virginia, after the DOJ claimed in January 2023 that Google violated US antitrust law by illegally monopolizing the digital ads market, allegedly boosting its profits while raising costs for advertisers. Google has said the DOJ’s reasoning “would slow innovation, raise advertising fees and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow.”",-0.012394957983193287,0

Bloomberg: US Says It’s Weighing Google Breakup as Monopoly Case Remedy,"The US Justice Department told a federal judge it is considering recommending that Google be forced to sell off parts of its operations to alleviate the harm caused by its monopolization of the online search market, in what would be a historic antitrust breakup.

In a court filing Tuesday, antitrust enforcers said Judge Amit Mehta could also force the Alphabet Inc. unit to provide access to the underlying data it uses to build its search results and artificial intelligence products.

The Justice Department “is considering behavioral and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search and Google search-related products and features — including emerging search access points and features, such as artificial intelligence — over rivals or new entrants,” the agency said in the filing.

The filing represents Washington’s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. The 32-page filing lays outs a framework of potential options for the judge to consider as the case moves to the remedy phase.

Antitrust enforcers said Google gained scale and data benefits from its illegal distribution agreements with other tech companies that made make its search engine the default option on smartphones and web browsers.

Mehta, who ruled this summer that Google broke antitrust laws in both online search and search text ads markets, plans to hold a trial on the proposed remedy next spring and issue a decision by August 2025. Google has already said it plans to appeal Mehta’s decision, but must wait until he finalizes a remedy before doing so.

Google’s Android business encompasses the operating system used on smartphones and devices as well as apps.

On Monday, a different federal judge ordered Google to open up its app store for the next three years to resolve a separate antitrust case related to its dominance of app distribution on Android smartphones. The company also plans to appeal that decision.

Shares of Amazon.com were up 2.6% at 2:09 p.m. on Monday, after rising 2.3% on Monday. With Monday’s move, Amazon passed Alphabet as the fourth-largest company in the U.S. for the first time since April 5. Alphabet’s stock has fallen 8.7% in September, while Amazon is off just 0.7%.

Amazon had some good news for investors at an investor conference, noting that its cloud business, AWS, is gaining further traction in AI but that it’s also focused on “balancing expenditures with revenue growth,” according to BofA analyst Justin Post.

There was also good news from Oracle’s earnings. Yes, most of the good news was for Oracle stock, which has risen 12% on Thursday.

Google CEO defends job cuts in animated town hall as employees demand clarity on process,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/23/google-ceo-defends-layoff-process-in-heated-town-hall-monday.html

Pichai said he consulted with the founders and controlling shareholders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, as well as the board of directors.

Pichai said 2021 marked “one of the strongest years we’ve ever had in the history of the company,” with 41% revenue growth. Google increased head count to match that expansion, and Pichai said the company was assuming growth would persist.

“In that context, we made a set of decisions that might have been right if the trends continued,” he said. “You have to remember if the trend had continued and we had not hired to keep pace, we would fall behind in many areas as a company.”

Executives said 750 senior leaders were involved in the process, adding it took a few weeks to determine who would be laid off.

“We have over 30,000 managers at Google and to consult with all of them would have made this an open process where it would have taken additional weeks or even months to come to a decision,” said Fiona Cicconi, Google’s chief people officer, at the meeting. “We wanted to get certainty sooner.”

Regarding the criteria for cuts, Cicconi said execs looked at areas where the work was necessary, but the company had too many people as well as places where the work itself wasn’t critical. Cicconi said the company considered “skill set, time in role where experience or relationships are relevant and matter, productivity indicators like sales quotas and performance history.”

Pichai indicated there would be executive compensation cuts but provided limited details. He said all senior vice presidents “will see a very significant reduction in their annual bonus” this year.

“The more senior you are, the more your compensation is tied to performance,” he said. “You can reduce your equity grants if performance is not great.”

Before the job cuts, Google had made the decision to pay out 80% of bonuses this month with the rest expected in March or April. In prior years, the full bonus was paid in January.",stocks,Google,"Google CEO defends job cuts in animated town hall as employees demand clarity on process Pichai said he consulted with the founders and controlling shareholders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, as well as the board of directors.

"Google, Meta, and others will have to explain their algorithms under new EU legislation","https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/23/23036976/eu-digital-services-act-finalized-algorithms-targeted-advertising

The EU has agreed on another ambitious piece of legislation to police the online world.

Early Saturday morning after hours of negotiations, the bloc agreed on the broad terms of the Digital Services Act, or DSA, which will force tech companies to take greater responsibility for content that appears on their platforms. New obligations include removing illegal content and goods more quickly, explaining to users and researchers how their algorithms work, and taking stricter action on the spread of misinformation. Companies face fines of up to six percent of their annual turnover for non-compliance.

Although the legislation only applies to EU citizens, the effect of these laws will certainly be felt in other parts of the world, too. Global tech companies may decide it is more cost-effective to implement a single strategy to police content and take the EU’s comparatively stringent regulations as their benchmark. While lawmakers in the US keen to rein in Big Tech with their own regulations have already begun looking to the EU’s rules for inspiration.

The final text of the DSA has yet to be released, but the European Parliament and European Commission have detailed a number of obligations it will contain:

* Targeted advertising based on an individuals’ religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity is banned. Minors cannot be subject to targeted advertising either.

* “Dark patterns” — confusing or deceptive user interfaces designed to steer users into making certain choices — will be prohibited. The EU says that, as a rule, cancelling subscriptions should be as easy as signing up for them.

* Large online platforms like Facebook will have to make the working of their recommender algorithms (e.g. used for sorting content on the News Feed or suggesting TV shows on Netflix) transparent to users. Users should also be offered a recommender system “not based on profiling.” In the case of Instagram, for example, this would mean a chronological feed (as it introduced recently).

* Hosting services and online platforms will have to explain clearly why they have removed illegal content, as well as give users the ability to appeal such takedowns. The DSA itself does not define what content is illegal, though, and leaves this up to individual countries.

* The largest online platforms will have to provide key data to researchers to “provide more insight into how online risks evolve.”

* Online marketplaces must keep basic information about traders on their platform to track down individuals selling illegal goods or services.

* Large platforms will also have to introduce new strategies for dealing with misinformation during crises (a provision inspired by the recent invasion of Ukraine).

The DSA will, like the DMA, distinguish between tech companies of different sizes, placing greater obligations on bigger companies. The largest firm — those with at least 45 million users in the EU, like Meta and Google — will face the most scrutiny. These tech companies have lobbied hard to water down the requirements in the DSA, particularly those concerning targeted advertising and handing over data to outside researchers.

Although the broad terms of the DSA have now been agreed upon by the member states of the EU, the legal language still needs to be finalized and the act officially voted into law. This last step is seen as a formality at this point, though. The rules will apply to all companies 15 months after the act is voted into law, or from 1 January 2024, whichever is later.",stocks,Google,"Google, Meta, and others will have to explain their algorithms under new EU legislation The EU has agreed on another ambitious piece of legislation to police the online world.

* What is your opinion of Eric Schmidt? Is he generally a trustworthy industry insider? Do you trust his opinions on this matter? (I looked for his name on this sub and it's rarely mentioned).

* If you don't trust him, what might be his motives for these comments? For example, is it perhaps to indirectly pump up his own Alphabet stock, which is probably #2 behind Nvidia and will benefit from big AI wave. (He owns 147 million shares)

Here's [link to the article](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/15/eric-schmidt-on-nvidia-you-know-what-to-do-in-the-stock-market.html) with some juicy bits:

* “I’m talking to the big companies, and the big companies are telling me they need $20 billion, $50 billion, $100 billion — very very hard,” said Schmidt, adding that he’s a “close friend” to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

* “If $300 billion is all going to Nvidia, you know what to do in the stock market,” Schmidt said. “That’s not a stock recommendation.” Schmidt didn’t say if he owns Nvidia shares.

* Schmidt, who was CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011 and remained on the board until 2019, was addressing a class of undergraduates on the topic of AI. He told the Wall Street Journal that he requested the video to be taken down because he had misspoken about Google’s lax work culture in the session.

* Schmidt suggested Nvidia won’t be the only winner in AI, but there aren’t a lot of other obvious choices. He said that he currently believes big companies who can invest more money into Nvidia chips and data centers will gain a technological lead over smaller competitors that can’t spend as freely.

* “At the moment, the gap between the frontier models — there are only three — and everyone else appears to be getting larger,” Schmidt said. “Six months ago, I was convinced that the gap was getting smaller, so I invested lots of money in the little companies. Now I’m not so sure.”

* Schmidt said it will be difficult for competitors to catch up with Nvidia because many of the most important open source tools that AI developers use are based on the company’s CUDA programming language. He said AMD’s software that translates Nvidia’s CUDA code for its own chips “doesn’t work yet.”

* Schmidt, who started venture firm Innovation Endeavors in 2010, still holds about 147 million shares of Alphabet, according to Bloomberg, valued at about $24 billion. In addition to startup investing, he has been a philanthropist and advised several government committees on technology.",stocks,Google,"Ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt sees Nvidia as big AI winner: ‘You know what to do in the stock market’ I'm not looking for another debate about whether Nvidia deserves its valuation -- we've had tons of threads about that already.

A leaked document from Google shows they believe Wall Street is too bullish on Microsoft’s Azure business,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/21/google-leaked-doc-microsoft-azure-losing-money-on-29-bln-in-revenue.html

Google has for years been playing catch-up in the cloud infrastructure market, where it’s seen in the industry as a distant third in the U.S., behind Amazon and Microsoft. The challenge for investors is that the three companies don’t report cloud infrastructure metrics in a way that makes them easily comparable. However, an internal estimate assembled by Google employees, based on a leaked Microsoft document and some extrapolation of other market statistics, suggests Google believes it’s closer to second place than analysts think.

Google’s document estimates that Microsoft generated under $29 billion in Azure consumption revenue in the latest fiscal year, which ended June 30, reflecting the value of cloud infrastructure services used by clients. That’s several billion dollars less than what Wall Street analysts had forecast. Bank of America was the most bullish, predicting Azure would pull in $37.5 billion in fiscal 2022. Cowen predicted revenue of $33.9 billion and UBS said $32.3 billion. The document from Google has Azure ending the 2022 fiscal year with an operating loss of almost $3 billion, down from a loss of more than $5 billion the prior year. It claims that Azure’s sales and marketing costs approached $10 billion, accounting for 34% of consumption revenue. Microsoft said sales and marketing costs for the whole company equaled 11% of revenue over the same period.

One analyst dismissed Google’s bottom-line tally. “There’s no way it’s that big of a loss,” said Derrick Wood, an analyst at Cowen who has the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft stock. His research shows Azure boasting an operating margin above 30%, compared with Google’s estimate of a -10% margin. According to data from Gartner, AWS controlled 39% of the global cloud infrastructure market in 2021, followed by Microsoft at 21%, China’s Alibaba at 9.5% and Google at 7.1%.",stocks,Google,"A leaked document from Google shows they believe Wall Street is too bullish on Microsoft’s Azure business Google has for years been playing catch-up in the cloud infrastructure market, where it’s seen in the industry as a distant third in the U.S., behind Amazon and Microsoft.

"Google reportedly in advanced talks to acquire cyber startup Wiz for $23 billion, its largest-ever deal","https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/14/google-wiz-cybersecurity-deal-largest-ever.html

Google is in advanced talks to acquire cybersecurity firm Wiz for $23 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. The people familiar told the Journal that a deal could come soon. Wiz was founded in 2020, and has grown at a rapid clip under CEO Assaf Rappaport. It had been eyeing an IPO as recently as May, when the company achieved a valuation of $12 billion.

Wiz’s cloud security offering gives executives and cybersecurity professionals insight into the company’s full cloud presence, something appealing to large firms with significant computing resources. It is backed by a roster of blue chip firms, including Israeli VC firm Cyberstarts, Index Ventures, Insight Partners and Sequoia Capital.

If completed, the deal would be Google’s largest ever acquisition. It would also underline a clear and continued bet on cybersecurity, at a time when nation state and criminal actors have managed to disrupt governments and large organizations. Google has made large cyber acquisitions before: The company acquired cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion two years ago. But the company now faces unprecedented levels of antitrust scrutiny. The Justice Department has sued Google twice on antitrust grounds. The company’s acquisition practices were highlighted in the most recent litigation, filed in 2023.

Epic Games wins antitrust lawsuit against Google,"
SAN FRANCISCO — Epic Games won an antitrust lawsuit against Google on Monday, in a landmark decision where a jury found Google broke competition laws in how it ran its app store.

The decision is a major blow to the tech giant and the concept that Big Tech companies should have complete control over how pricing and payments are done on their massive internet platforms. It could open up other challenges to how large tech companies govern their marketplaces, potentially forcing them to allow alternate payment processors. That could cut into revenue for Google and other companies like Apple and Amazon, which make money by charging fees on any transactions on their platforms.

In summer 2020, Epic had revolted against Apple and Google’s payment-sharing systems for app developers. Epic tweaked its popular Fortnite app so users could pay the company directly. First Apple, then Google, booted Fortnite from their app stores for violating terms. Epic sued both companies, arguing the rules violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.

Apple's Popularity With Gen Z Poses Challenges for Google/Android," Younger Americans prefer Apple over rival companies by significant margins, driving a generational shift toward Apple devices and social pressure, the [*Financial Times*](https://www.ft.com/content/8a2e8442-449e-4dbd-bd6d-2656b4503526) reports. 

 

According to the report, younger consumers are concerned about being socially ostracised for not having an [iPhone](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/) – a phenomenon that is driving young people to buy other Apple products and services, leading to growing market share across multiple product categories.

Those born after 1996, also known as Gen Z, compose 34 percent of all ‌iPhone‌ owners in the U.S., compared to just 10 percent for Samsung. For older generations, there is a relatively even split between ‌iPhone‌ and Android users. The ramifications of this shift toward Apple devices among younger people extends beyond iPhones, with these users being much more likely to purchase AirPods, Apple Watches, and Macs.

For every 100 iPhones Apple sells around the world, it also sells 26 iPads, 17 Apple Watches, and 35 pairs of AirPods, according to research by Canalys. For Samsung, every 100 smartphone sales leads to fewer than 11 tablets, six smartwatches, and six pairs of wireless earbuds being sold. This is in spite of the fact that the average selling price of an ‌iPhone‌ is almost three times that of an Android device.

Researchers who advise companies about the preferences of Gen Z consumers told the *Financial Times* that these customers are the most online of any age group, spending up to six hours a day on their smartphones. As a result, Apple's ecosystem is shaping social decision-making, with particular emphasis on the importance of iMessage as a social signal, necessitated by inferior experiences messaging and using group chats via SMS.

In Europe, where iMessage is less prevalent and Android has a bigger market share, the same trend is similarly visible. Canalys research indicates that 83 percent of Apple users in western Europe under 25 years old plan to keep using an ‌iPhone‌. As Gen Z gets older, this trend is likely to grow and further entrench Apple's market share, making it increasingly difficult for rival companies to capture new customers and make inroads.",stocks,Google,"Apple's Popularity With Gen Z Poses Challenges for Google/Android Younger Americans prefer Apple over rival companies by significant margins, driving a generational shift toward Apple devices and social pressure, the [*Financial Times*]( reports.

It’s ‘really the Google web’: Microsoft CEO testifies about how hard it is to break into search during antitrust trial,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/02/microsoft-ceo-testifies-about-competing-with-google-in-antitrust-trial.html

When it comes to online search, it’s Google’s web and everyone else is playing in it, according to rival Microsoft. That was the essence of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s testimony in federal court on Monday as part of the government’s antitrust trial against Google. Nadella told the court that Google’s dominant market share in online search means that publishers and advertisers shape their content to Google’s requirements, making it harder for competitors like Microsoft’s Bing to gain a foothold.

“Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web,” Nadella said from the stand in Washington, D.C., District Court. Nadella was referring to the way publishers often cater their content and advertising to Google’s products, like by optimizing their pages for how Google ranks search results. Nadella was questioned by lawyers for the Department of Justice and a coalition of state attorneys general who are suing Google for allegedly violating antitrust laws by illegally maintaining a monopoly in the general search market. The government argues that Google locked up distribution channels for general search engines through exclusive deals with browser and phone makers to be the default choice on various devices. Perhaps the most famous of those deals is the multibillion-dollar agreement between Google and Apple to make Google search the default on Apple products like the iPhone.

The government has tried to make the case that Google’s dominance, aided by these exclusive deals, creates a flywheel effect, where greater exposure to users leads to more data to make Google’s search results better and attracts more advertisers to the product. That, in turn, generates more revenue that can be used to fund these massive distribution deals. Meanwhile, the government argues, it becomes even harder for rivals to breakthrough to consumers, and as a result, they miss out on the opportunity for greater benefits or innovations in search. Nadella affirmed that argument in his testimony Monday, describing the obstacles a general search competitor like Bing faces to gain more market share from Google.",stocks,Google,"It’s ‘really the Google web’: Microsoft CEO testifies about how hard it is to break into search during antitrust trial When it comes to online search, it’s Google’s web and everyone else is playing in it, according to rival Microsoft.

Google is a better long term hold than Microsoft.,"This is anecdotal. I’m stupid so take it with a grain of salt.

I work in IT in public education. Hence I’m stupid and can’t do anything else more promising in tech. 

Think about your first interactions with a computer. Word processing maybe? Kids are not using Word these days, like at all. Maybe you first word processed with Word. Maybe you grew up with Office products. This generation isn’t. 

Edit: They’re not using PowerPoint, they’re using Slides. They’re not using Excel, they’re using Sheets. They’re not using Outlook, they’re using Gmail. They’re not using Microsoft Teams, they’re using Zoom, and then in 2nd for video conferencing they’re using Google Meet. Office isn’t necessarily Microsoft’s primary business, but the battle between Microsoft and Google is a battle for mass adoption. And Google right now is planting seeds to have an iron grip on Gen Z when they enter the private sector later on. Microsoft will have to fight to hold market share and I reckon they’ll lose vs Google long term. The game is a fight for mass adoption, and there’s numerous ways to monetize mass adoption. Want a cheap Windows computer that’s sub $300? They absolutely suck, they’re terrible. Want a Chromebook that’s sub $300? They’re decent, snappy useable machines. Look to the developing world. As network infrastructure improves, cheap web based Chromebooks will continue to be a hit among low income consumers in developing nations. Who’s better positioned to scale as the world gets more and more connected? My vote is for Google.

They know that their long term future depends on kids getting hooked on their products, so that when they’re leaders of companies in the future, their company is powered by Google Workspace and not Office. Google beat Microsoft and Apple in the education market. ChromeOS now has more market share than MacOS. Kids are doing all of their productivity tasks in the Google ecosystem. Remember back in 2016/17 when you might have said to yourself, “why do all these kids want to be Youtubers when they grow up?” I know why this happened. I’ve seen the district dashboard data. YouTube is the #1 site kids use on their school issued Chromebook.

Edit: You might say to yourself, Apple won the education market in the 80s/90s, but the enterprise market is still driven by Microsoft. Back then there were like 10 Macs in a lab for 500 kids to share. What Google has accomplished is way more impactful. Literally every kid 1 to 1 in public schools now has a Chromebook in their backpack. This is much more groundbreaking than what Apple did and will help Google retain a generation’s worth of customers as they age into adulthood.

Office products will do well for the next 20 years in enterprise settings. And then all of the sudden Google Workspace will be king in enterprise. Why? Because they planted the seeds and won the public education market and brainwashed millions of kids.

* Apple and Epic went to court today so that Epic could argue for a temporary court order that would force Apple to unblock Fortnite from its iOS App Store. 

* ""The case is considered a potentially landmark suit, one that tests the frontiers of antitrust law, said Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.""

* Judge Gonzalez Rogers looked skeptically at many of Epic's claims, explicitly telling the company several times in the hearing she was not persuaded by its arguments or its strategy. Epic knew that it was breaching its contract with Apple when it published the update, but did it anyway, she said, accusing the company of dishonesty. She rejected claims that Apple's in-app payment system is a separate product an an example of illegal bundling, as well as that Apple's app store operates as a monopoly.

* Fortnite players on iOS have a variety of choices to access the game even if it is no longer available on iOS, she said. ""Walled gardens have existed for decades,"" she said. ""Nintendo has had a walled garden. Sony has had a walled garden. Microsoft has had a walled garden. What Apple's doing is not much different... It's hard to ignore the economics of the industry, which is what you're asking me to do.""

* Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers recommended a jury trial in the case in July. “It is important enough to understand what real people think,” she said. “Do these security issues concern people or not?” (in reference to Apple's argument that tight control over its App Store to keep customers’ data secure and private.)

* In the coming days, Gonzalez Rogers is expected to rule on a temporary injunction forcing Apple to allow Fortnite back into its App Store and support Unreal Engine, Epic’s software development tools, in the interim.

* Separately on Monday, Google announced it will enforce rules that require app developers distributing Android software on the Google Play Store to use its in-app payment system. The move means that developers who have had customers pay them directly with a credit card for digital content will soon have to use Google’s billing system, which takes a 30% fee from payments.",investing,GOOGL,"Judge not convinced by Epic's arguments against Apple; Google to begin collecting 30% cut on in-app purchases in 2021 Relevant articles: [NYTimes]( [CNN]( [CNBC]( * Apple and Epic went to court today so that Epic could argue for a temporary court order that would force Apple to unblock Fortnite from its iOS App Store. * ""The case is considered a potentially landmark suit, one that tests the frontiers of antitrust law, said Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California."" * Judge Gonzalez Rogers looked skeptically at many of Epic's claims, explicitly telling the company several times in the hearing she was not persuaded by its arguments or its strategy.

"With MSFT, AAPL AMZN, GOOGL and FB making up more than 1/5 of the S&P500, what are practical ways to de-risk your portfolio from this imbalance?","For those who subscribe to having the majority or the entirety of their equity holdings to consist of ETF/funds from the S&P 500, the impact to their portfolio as a function of any one company has increased substantially.

Even with total market funds like Vanguard's VTI, these five stocks make up an outsized portion of the fund because of market cap weight.  

Much like investors using ""ex-US"" funds to increase exposure to international holdings, are there funds that are ""ex-FAANG"" so individuals can lessen the impact?

How Do You Feel About Investing In Google Now?,"Last year I started a similar thread following the disastrous Helpful Content Update where Google started de-indexing many of the best small to medium sized informational websites. Depending on what area of the internet you are searching in you might not notice quickly, but once you go to a space of search where it happened (like Local) you notice it instantly.

Well here we are over a year later and things have only gotten worse. I don't know anyone who is satisfied with the search results, and many like myself have avoided using Google as much as possible.

"Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) Analysis","Hey Guys whats up, this is my first analysis. I would like to get some feedback on it so give me your thoughts.

# Core Business

Google’s operations are divided in three categories: Google Services, Google Cloud and so called “Other Bets” consisting of several ventures including A.I., robotics, autonomous driving and pharmacy. As Google Services and Google Cloud generate >99% of Google’s revenue I won’t go into much detail on the “Other Bets” Category.

## Relevant Acquisitions

Through it’s acquisition activity google amassed around 250 acquisitions, expanding their research capabilities in fields like A.I., quantum computing and robotics. Below the most important ones are summarized.

**Youtube**

The most famous one of all Google acquisitions. Purchased in 2006 for 1.65 billion dollars Youtube has risen to world wide success and an unchallenged standing almost as relevant as it’s parent company. With revenues as high as 28,8 billion dollars (2021), it generates over 10% of Google’s revenue. It has proven to further expand their earnings-power besides ads with it’s Youtube Premium and Music subscription, which according to Alphabet was the major contributer to an increase of $6.3 billion in Google’s “Other Revenues” (1).

**DoubleClick**

DoubleClick was an ad service provider, who worked with advertising agencies and served major brands like Coca-Cola, GM and Microsoft. After it’s acquisition in 2008 for $3.1 billion lots of customer relations and technology was integrated into Googles ad business. In 2018 Google announced it’s plan to rebrand all ad platforms and merged DoubleClick with Googles own ad platform into the new Google Marketing Platform (2).

**Motorola Mobility**

When Google acquired Motorola in 2011, the company was struggling to gain a foothold in the smartphone business and reported the fifth straight quarter of losses. The company cost $12.5 billion dollar, Google’s largest acquisition, and was motivated as a strategic move to increase Google’s patent ownership and defend the Android operating system. After closing the deal Google sold parts of the business to Arris Group for $2.35 billion and led the smartphone division to success through a focus on high-quality entry-level smartphones. In 2014 Google sold Motorola for $2.91 billion, while keeping a major part of the patents. (3)

**Mandiant**

Google announced that Mandiant would be acquired in March 2022, to get integrated into the Google Cloud division.

**Fitbit**

Fitbit, a producer of wearable technology was acquired by Google in January 2021 and integrated into it’s hardware division.

**Nest Labs**

To expand it’s home automation business Google acquired Nest labs in 2014 for §3.2 billion and merged it with the Google Home brand in 2018 to create Google Nest.

## Industry Enviroment / Competition

**Advertising**

Through it’s search engine and Youtube, Google generates significant revenue with advertisment campaigns for it’s customers. It is unchallenged with a market share of 92% for it’s search engine and Google Chrome leading the browser market with 65% (4). Competition in it’s most relevant business is almost irrelevant for it’s earnings power and market position as most major players (Microsoft with Bing, Yahoo) have failed to attack it.

**Google Cloud**

In the highly competitive cloud computing industry Google competes with giants like Microsoft, Alibaba and Amazon. It isn’t in a leading position, but increased it’s market share from 5% (2017) to 10% (2021) with only AWS and Microsoft Azure above. (5) (6)

## Income Statement

## Revenue Growth

Google’s revenue has increased by an average of 21% annually in the last 10 years. With Growth accelerating in the past 5 years (23,3%), the question should be if similar growth can be expected in the future.

Google’s main business of advertising stands as strong as we have discussed above and with more digitilization and e-commerce growth not slowing down the market for it’s search engine and it’s ads will continue to grow. Growth projections in that business reach from 11% to 15%. (8) (9)

As Google Cloud has gained more market share in the last years and has grown it’s revenue by more than 40% on average, it’s safe to say that it will grow at least as much as the overall cloud computing industry if not more. In a recent market research report a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of over 16% was forecasted until 2026. We will take that at face value for our worst case scenario and will add to it as in a best case scenario, Google will gain more market share. (10)

## Cost Development

|European fines|||50,17%|\-71,71%|\-100,00%||

In recent history Google was able to decrease different parts of it’s costs effectively, thus increasing profitablility. Cost of revenue is made up of \*\*\*\*traffic acquisition costs (TAC) and other revenue costs. **TAC** consists of payments made to traffic distributors, giving Google the platform and audience to advertise for it’s clients.

Other revenue costs consist of licensing fees for **acquired content** sold on YouTube and Google Play, expenses in it’s **data centers** and costs related to Google’s **hardware business**.

**Composition of cost of revenue (COR) (Table 4)**

|Cost in ($ Mio)/Year|2020|2021|
|:-|:-|:-|
|TAC|32,778|45,566|
|Other COR|51,954|65,373|
|Total COR|84,732|110,939|

With past cost development it’s important to use the studied data to make forecasts into the future regarding revenue, cost and profit development to feed our DCF model. We will look for patterns in which relation costs follow growing revenue. With the following table I will try to point that out.

||2013-2014|2014-2015|2015-2016|2016-2017|2017-2018|2018-2019|2019-2020|2020-2021|Average|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue Growth|18,88%|13,62%|20,38%|22,80%|23,42%|18,30%|12,77%|41,15%|21,42%|
|COR|16,81%|9,63%|24,76%|29,73%|30,64%|20,73%|17,85%|30,93%|22,64%|
|R&D|37,76%|24,92%|13,56%|19,19%|28,84%|21,47%|5,98%|14,47%|20,77%|
|Sales and Market|24,06%|11,27%|15,89%|22,97%|26,68%|13,05%|\-2,81%|27,67%|17,35%|
|General&Admin|32,02%|4,87%|13,84%|\-1,62%|18,25%|17,54%|15,72%|22,24%|15,36%|

The cost of revenue has trailed revenue quite close and I expect it to continue to be around 40-43% of all revenue. R&D expenses have risen with revenue but have slown down in recent years. It’s not attached to revenue growth directly, but we will assume a small average growth of 10% for the upcoming years as the R&D expenses are already high enough to guarantee Google to be a potential player in all upcoming high-tech industries. Further reductions in the SGA expenses relative to revenue is possible with revenue outpacing those costs, as it has been seen in the past. Still we will assume it too be just stable to have a more conservative approach.

## Balance Sheet

## Debt Level

Google’s long term debt is almost non-existing with $15 billion. It’s earnings were >$70 billion in 2021 so it’s debt could have been paid off with just 20% of that. The company also hold’s $21 billion in cash, which makes debt for the valuation almost irrelevant.

## Capital Intensity

As Google’s business needs large amounts of land, offices and server infrastructure. Aside from large marketable securities positions, most capital is tied up in purchased land, offices and information technology assets like server farms. The company is determined to expand it’s position in that area, which will result in rising capital expenditures for both new offices and new IT assets. (1)

## Liquidation Value / Tangible Book Value

To calculate the Tangible Book Value I will use the most recent book value and exclude all assets I think are intangible. TBV calculation in $billion:

|Book Value|254,004|
|:-|:-|
|\-Goodwill|\-23,010|
|\-Property and Equipment|\-104,218|
|\-Other non-current assets|\-5,778|
|TBV|120,998|

Note: I didn’t exclude smaller positions as it would make the formular unnecessarilly large with no real effect. It’s also quite reasonable as normally the Property and Equipment of Google of cause could be sold for at least a fraction of the audited value.

Google has a TBV per share of: $120998 million / 673.22 million shares = $179,73 per share

## Cashflow Statement

IT assets generally have a high turnover frequence which results in short depreciating periods (4-5 years). The replacement makes up a large portion of the $24.6 billion of capital expenditures, which are needed for the business operation.

Still Google has great liquidity through it’s short-term marketable securities and it’s large cash reserves.

With almost over $60 billion dollar of free cashflow, Google used most of it ($50 billion) to make stock repurchases. Still the company has only really started to do repurchases in the last 4-5 years and because of it’s high valuation the amount of shares outstanding has only decreased by 5% in 3 years, which is quite a disappointment (11). $15 billion were paid in stock compensation and to account for that we won’t add it back into the DCF-valuation even though it’s a non-cash expense.

## Other

## Insider Trading / Ownership

Insider Trading has no significance for Google as high management only sold insignificant portions of their ownership. (12)

The founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin still have small stakes in the company of around 3% each, even though they slowly continue to sell them off. There is also no insider with a significant stake in the company. (12)

## Risks

* Lower advertising spending by customers
* Google’s value for it’s customers could decline
* Competition disrupting the occupied markets

## DCF Model

Summary of the Assumptions made:

* The revenue of Google Services will increase with the projected growth of the overall market of 11%-15%, which is conservative as parts like Youtube are growing at much higher rates
* Google Cloud’s revenue has increased at an annual growth rate of over 40%. In a worst case scenario it will grow at a CAGR of 16% in line with it’s industry projection, but there is a real possibility of it to accelerate at the current rate until it has gained enough size. Our worst, base and best case projection will still stay conservative at 16%-24$
* As COR is staying volatile around 45% of revenue we will assume it to stay at that level
* R&D will rise around 10% every year unrelated to revenues
* SGA (sales, general, administration) expenses will stay at the current level of 14% relative to revenues and won’t decrease any further
* capital expenses have remained quite stable at around $24 billion dollars. We will still assume an increase of 10% per year as in the most recent 10-Q report the capex has risen by over 40%.
* Depreciation rises at CapEx rate
* 2021 is not an outlier
* Share repurchases will range between 2-5% per year, as those are highly dependent on the share price

We will use a projection of the next 15 years to determine Google’s fair value in 3 scenarios at a **discount rate of 8%**

||Worst Case|Base Case|Best Case|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Google Ads CAGR|11%|13%|15%|
|Google Cloud CAGR|16%|20%|24%|
|COR|45% of total rev|“”|“”|
|R&D CAGR|10%|“”|“”|
|SGA|14% of total rev|“”|""”|
|CapEx and Depreciation|10%|“”|""”|
|Share repurchases|2%|3,5%|5%|
|Fair Value|$1690|$2518|$3805|

I would consider te base case to be highly plausible as past growth has indicated much higher growth rates. Of course it’s up to you to choose your margin of safety, but I will consider to pick up some shares if Google falls below $2000.

It has proven to further expand their earnings-power besides ads with it’s Youtube Premium and Music subscription, which according to Alphabet was the major contributer to an increase of $6.3 billion in Google’s “Other Revenues” (1). **DoubleClick** DoubleClick was an ad service provider, who worked with advertising agencies and served major brands like Coca-Cola, GM and Microsoft. After it’s acquisition in 2008 for $3.1 billion lots of customer relations and technology was integrated into Googles ad business. In 2018 Google announced it’s plan to rebrand all ad platforms and merged DoubleClick with Googles own ad platform into the new Google Marketing Platform (2). **Motorola Mobility** When Google acquired Motorola in 2011, the company was struggling to gain a foothold in the smartphone business and reported the fifth straight quarter of losses. The company cost $12.5 billion dollar, Google’s largest acquisition, and was motivated as a strategic move to increase Google’s patent ownership and defend the Android operating system. After closing the deal Google sold parts of the business to Arris Group for $2.35 billion and led the smartphone division to success through a focus on high-quality entry-level smartphones. In 2014 Google sold Motorola for $2.91 billion, while keeping a major part of the patents. (3) **Mandiant** Google announced that Mandiant would be acquired in March 2022, to get integrated into the Google Cloud division. **Fitbit** Fitbit, a producer of wearable technology was acquired by Google in January 2021 and integrated into it’s hardware division. **Nest Labs** To expand it’s home automation business Google acquired Nest labs in 2014 for §3.2 billion and merged it with the Google Home brand in 2018 to create Google Nest. ## Industry Enviroment / Competition **Advertising** Through it’s search engine and Youtube, Google generates significant revenue with advertisment campaigns for it’s customers. It is unchallenged with a market share of 92% for it’s search engine and Google Chrome leading the browser market with 65% (4). Competition in it’s most relevant business is almost irrelevant for it’s earnings power and market position as most major players (Microsoft with Bing, Yahoo) have failed to attack it. **Google Cloud** In the highly competitive cloud computing industry Google competes with giants like Microsoft, Alibaba and Amazon. It isn’t in a leading position, but increased it’s market share from 5% (2017) to 10% (2021) with only AWS and Microsoft Azure above. (5) (6) ## Income Statement ## Revenue Growth Google’s revenue has increased by an average of 21% annually in the last 10 years. With Growth accelerating in the past 5 years (23,3%), the question should be if similar growth can be expected in the future. Google’s main business of advertising stands as strong as we have discussed above and with more digitilization and e-commerce growth not slowing down the market for it’s search engine and it’s ads will continue to grow. Growth projections in that business reach from 11% to 15%. (8) (9) As Google Cloud has gained more market share in the last years and has grown it’s revenue by more than 40% on average, it’s safe to say that it will grow at least as much as the overall cloud computing industry if not more. In a recent market research report a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of over 16% was forecasted until 2026. We will take that at face value for our worst case scenario and will add to it as in a best case scenario, Google will gain more market share.

Cost of revenue is made up of \*\*\*\*traffic acquisition costs (TAC) and other revenue costs. **TAC** consists of payments made to traffic distributors, giving Google the platform and audience to advertise for it’s clients. Other revenue costs consist of licensing fees for **acquired content** sold on YouTube and Google Play, expenses in it’s **data centers** and costs related to Google’s **hardware business**. **Composition of cost of revenue (COR) (Table 4)** |Cost in ($ Mio)/Year|2020|2021| |:-|:-|:-| |TAC|32,778|45,566| |Other COR|51,954|65,373| |Total COR|84,732|110,939| With past cost development it’s important to use the studied data to make forecasts into the future regarding revenue, cost and profit development to feed our DCF model. We will look for patterns in which relation costs follow growing revenue. With the following table I will try to point that out. ||2013-2014|2014-2015|2015-2016|2016-2017|2017-2018|2018-2019|2019-2020|2020-2021|Average| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Revenue Growth|18,88%|13,62%|20,38%|22,80%|23,42%|18,30%|12,77%|41,15%|21,42%| |COR|16,81%|9,63%|24,76%|29,73%|30,64%|20,73%|17,85%|30,93%|22,64%| |R&D|37,76%|24,92%|13,56%|19,19%|28,84%|21,47%|5,98%|14,47%|20,77%| |Sales and Market|24,06%|11,27%|15,89%|22,97%|26,68%|13,05%|\-2,81%|27,67%|17,35%| |General&Admin|32,02%|4,87%|13,84%|\-1,62%|18,25%|17,54%|15,72%|22,24%|15,36%| The cost of revenue has trailed revenue quite close and I expect it to continue to be around 40-43% of all revenue. R&D expenses have risen with revenue but have slown down in recent years. It’s not attached to revenue growth directly, but we will assume a small average growth of 10% for the upcoming years as the R&D expenses are already high enough to guarantee Google to be a potential player in all upcoming high-tech industries. Further reductions in the SGA expenses relative to revenue is possible with revenue outpacing those costs, as it has been seen in the past. Still we will assume it too be just stable to have a more conservative approach. ## Balance Sheet ## Debt Level Google’s long term debt is almost non-existing with $15 billion. It’s earnings were >$70 billion in 2021 so it’s debt could have been paid off with just 20% of that. The company also hold’s $21 billion in cash, which makes debt for the valuation almost irrelevant. ## Capital Intensity As Google’s business needs large amounts of land, offices and server infrastructure. Aside from large marketable securities positions, most capital is tied up in purchased land, offices and information technology assets like server farms. The company is determined to expand it’s position in that area, which will result in rising capital expenditures for both new offices and new IT assets. (1) ## Liquidation Value / Tangible Book Value To calculate the Tangible Book Value I will use the most recent book value and exclude all assets I think are intangible. TBV calculation in $billion: |Book Value|254,004| |:-|:-| |\-Goodwill|\-23,010| |\-Property and Equipment|\-104,218| |\-Other non-current assets|\-5,778| |TBV|120,998| Note: I didn’t exclude smaller positions as it would make the formular unnecessarilly large with no real effect. It’s also quite reasonable as normally the Property and Equipment of Google of cause could be sold for at least a fraction of the audited value. Google has a TBV per share of: $120998 million / 673.22 million shares = $179,73 per share ## Cashflow Statement IT assets generally have a high turnover frequence which results in short depreciating periods (4-5 years). The replacement makes up a large portion of the $24.6 billion of capital expenditures, which are needed for the business operation. Still Google has great liquidity through it’s short-term marketable securities and it’s large cash reserves. With almost over $60 billion dollar of free cashflow, Google used most of it ($50 billion) to make stock repurchases. Still the company has only really started to do repurchases in the last 4-5 years and because of it’s high valuation the amount of shares outstanding has only decreased by 5% in 3 years, which is quite a disappointment (11). $15 billion were paid in stock compensation and to account for that we won’t add it back into the DCF-valuation even though it’s a non-cash expense. ## Other ## Insider Trading / Ownership Insider Trading has no significance for Google as high management only sold insignificant portions of their ownership. (12) The founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin still have small stakes in the company of around 3% each, even though they slowly continue to sell them off. There is also no insider with a significant stake in the company. (12) ## Risks * Lower advertising spending by customers * Google’s value for it’s customers could decline * Competition disrupting the occupied markets ## DCF Model Summary of the Assumptions made: * The revenue of Google Services will increase with the projected growth of the overall market of 11%-15%, which is conservative as parts like Youtube are growing at much higher rates * Google Cloud’s revenue has increased at an annual growth rate of over 40%. In a worst case scenario it will grow at a CAGR of 16% in line with it’s industry projection, but there is a real possibility of it to accelerate at the current rate until it has gained enough size. Our worst, base and best case projection will still stay conservative at 16%-24$ * As COR is staying volatile around 45% of revenue we will assume it to stay at that level * R&D will rise around 10% every year unrelated to revenues * SGA (sales, general, administration) expenses will stay at the current level of 14% relative to revenues and won’t decrease any further * capital expenses have remained quite stable at around $24 billion dollars. We will still assume an increase of 10% per year as in the most recent 10-Q report the capex has risen by over 40%. * Depreciation rises at CapEx rate * 2021 is not an outlier * Share repurchases will range between 2-5% per year, as those are highly dependent on the share price We will use a projection of the next 15 years to determine Google’s fair value in 3 scenarios at a **discount rate of 8%** ||Worst Case|Base Case|Best Case| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Google Ads CAGR|11%|13%|15%| |Google Cloud CAGR|16%|20%|24%| |COR|45% of total rev|“”|“”| |R&D CAGR|10%|“”|“”| |SGA|14% of total rev|“”|""”| |CapEx and Depreciation|10%|“”|""”| |Share repurchases|2%|3,5%|5%| |Fair Value|$1690|$2518|$3805| I would consider te base case to be highly plausible as past growth has indicated much higher growth rates. Of course it’s up to you to choose your margin of safety, but I will consider to pick up some shares if Google falls below $2000. ## Sources (1) [ (2) [ (3) [ (4) [ (5) [ (6) [ (7) [ (8) [ (9) [ (10) [ (11) [ (12) [",0.08130196413635903,1

Plans to File Antitrust Charges Against Google in Coming Weeks,"[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/politics/google-antitrust-justice-department.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/politics/google-antitrust-justice-department.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)

Key Excerpts:

&#x200B;

>The Justice Department plans to bring an antitrust case against Google as soon as this month, after Attorney General William P. Barr overruled career lawyers who said they needed more time to build a strong case against one of the world’s wealthiest, most formidable technology companies, according to five people briefed on internal department conversations.  
>  
>Justice Department officials told lawyers involved in the antitrust inquiry into Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, to wrap up their work by the end of September, according to three of the people. Most of the 40-odd lawyers who had been working on the investigation opposed the deadline. Some said they would not sign the complaint, and several of them left the case this summer.

&#x200B;

>Brianna Herlihy, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment on the continuing investigation. Jose Castaneda, a spokesman for Google, said that the company would “continue to engage with ongoing investigations” and that its business practices enabled “increased choice and competition.”

&#x200B;

>The Justice Department amassed powerful evidence of anticompetitive practices, three people said.  
>  
>But the lawyers also described internal politics that at times slowed down the department’s work or drove a wedge among members of the team.

&#x200B;

>For nearly a year, dozens of Justice Department lawyers and other staff members worked in two groups, each overseeing a separate line of inquiry: Google’s dominance in search and its control over many aspects of the ecosystem for online advertising.

&#x200B;

>Google controls about 90 percent of web searches globally, and rivals have complained that the company extended its dominance by making its search and browsing tools defaults on phones with its Android operating system. Google also captures about one-third of every dollar spent on online advertising, and its ad tools are used to supply and auction ads that appear across the internet.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech seems to have picked up with Google in the Trump Administrations crosshairs. Despite broad bipartisan support in Congress and amongst 50 state AGs, there seems to be some politicking, or at least the appearance of such, that could slow down the government's case.

What should Apple do to replace the money they get from Google?,"It is looking like the US DOJ no longer thinks it is OK for Google to pay Apple to be the default search engine on iOS, MacOS, etc.

The most likely resolution will be that the first time you turn on your iPhone you are given a screen with the different search engines in a random list.

You then choose your search engine.  Free to change later but likely most will not.  This will be basically you choosing your default search engine.

I believe this is going to be the toughest decision yet needed to be made by Tim Cook.   He could have Apple try to create their own search engine and then sell advertising with the new Apple search engine to try to replace the lost revenue.

Can TikTok Impact the Bottom Lines for Meta (Facebook) and Google (Youtube)? Is Tiktok an Existential threat for Meta? [I don't think So],"Maybe I do not know Tiktok well enough, but it doesn't have a hook like facebook does to get people to come back. Even though people do not use [facebook.com](https://facebook.com) as much, people are still using messenger for messaging their friends or whatsapp or Instagram. Tiktok is more similar to youtube in this regard in that from my understanding it is not being used as a way for connecting with friends and planning social events, eg ""dinner @ 8, who's in?"" 

&#x200B;

Talking with my dad about Nvidia over Thanksgiving,"My dad is an active investor, has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.

The knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the ""other stuff"" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their ""AI hardware"" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \*literally\* the same thing.

They didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.

This came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.

As to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.

Before all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they've been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use-cases (e.g. tensor-cores) and they're not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data-center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards.

I don't mean to discount their good work, they've done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible, there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck.

"7 years from $0 to $100k, 3 years from $100k to $200k","I joined eTrade in 2013 a few years after graduating college. I had set up automatic monthly contributions to my accounts, which I slowly raised over time and mostly invested in blue chip stocks. 

On December 1, 2020, the combined value of my Roth and Traditional Brokerage account was just over $100k. It took me over seven years to get there and was a major milestone.  In the past three years, I have raised my monthly contributions, continued to invest, and am now just shy of $200k at the age of 35. You read about the power of compound gains all the time, but to go from $100k to $200k in three years when the first $100k took seven years is a testiment to that fact.  My goal is $1 mil by 47 and eventually to hit $2.5 mil before I retire. 

For all you youngins out there, stick with it! But also, don't rush the process and try to hit home runs every day. For the most part, I am a buy and hold investor after a year or two of trying my hand at day trading with options and futures. When you chase the money, you won't make it. But if you’re patient with a decent risk tolerance, anything is possible. 



Edit: Wow, thanks for the up votes everyone. It’s been fun reading the comments. Adding some context here based on some of the questions that have come in. Monthly contributions are at $1,000 a month now, but in the early years they were less. When I first started, it was $100 a month and I worked my way up from there. There was a good chunk of time where they were between $200-$500 a month. These accounts were set up on my own, no employer match. I’m not sure what my lifetime performance is, but the last three years I’m up 30% overall. All that in mind, I can confidently say that well over half of my account is due to investment gains. 

Investments have been all individual stocks that I typically hold for a year or longer. I pick them based on both technical and fundamental factors. This is more risky than ETFs and index funds but it suits my investing style and risk tolerance. I try to stick to profitable companies with a stock price that has a history of moving in the right direction, however I also like to buy at a discount price. I keep my eyes on charts and when there’s opportunities to buy at historically undervalued prices I jump on it. There’s really nothing super special to it. Not going to share my current exact portfolio, but stocks I have owned in the past or currently include AAPL, GOOGL, META, COST, HD, MCD, DKNG, AMD, DIS, and BAC to name a few. There are many others I’m interested in buying that are on my watchlist.

I will also add that I’ve made a ton of mistakes along the way. Bad investments, selling too soon when I should of just held, taking risky, over leveraged day trades that resulted in nasty losses and wash sales. However, I’ve learned from them and never done anything bad enough that blew an account or resulted in a draw down that couldn’t be recovered.

However, I’ve learned from them and never done anything bad enough that blew an account or resulted in a draw down that couldn’t be recovered.

With the PE trading near ten year low, the recent news on youtube premium subscription growing 60% yoy to 80 million accounts, and the general attractiveness of the company’s economics (margins, FCF, etc), is this a value no-brainer? Most importantly, the company has massive competitive advantages. As Munger once put it: “Google has a huge new moat. In fact I’ve probably never seen such a wide moat. Their moat is filled with sharks.” Pretty high conviction coming from him (Warren has praised the company multiple times as well).

I don’t know the ad space well, but I feel like I understand google well enough to see some notable data advantages over companies like Meta or Amazon. Therefore any near-term softness in the ad space won't impact the financials in the long term. But then again I may not know what I’m talking about.

Going along with the philosophy of buying a great business at a fair price, this seems like a sound long-term decision. I wouldn’t assume the annual returns over the next ten years will be insane, but I’d expect the company to outperform by a few percentage points annually at least if we assume that free cash flow will be somewhat higher in ten years than it is now.

What’s the bear case? Competition in the ad market? Regulation? Curious to discover my potential blindspots.

* Apple and Epic went to court today so that Epic could argue for a temporary court order that would force Apple to unblock Fortnite from its iOS App Store. 

* ""The case is considered a potentially landmark suit, one that tests the frontiers of antitrust law, said Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.""

* Judge Gonzalez Rogers looked skeptically at many of Epic's claims, explicitly telling the company several times in the hearing she was not persuaded by its arguments or its strategy. Epic knew that it was breaching its contract with Apple when it published the update, but did it anyway, she said, accusing the company of dishonesty. She rejected claims that Apple's in-app payment system is a separate product an an example of illegal bundling, as well as that Apple's app store operates as a monopoly.

* Fortnite players on iOS have a variety of choices to access the game even if it is no longer available on iOS, she said. ""Walled gardens have existed for decades,"" she said.

* In the coming days, Gonzalez Rogers is expected to rule on a temporary injunction forcing Apple to allow Fortnite back into its App Store and support Unreal Engine, Epic’s software development tools, in the interim.

* Separately on Monday, Google announced it will enforce rules that require app developers distributing Android software on the Google Play Store to use its in-app payment system.

"With MSFT, AAPL AMZN, GOOGL and FB making up more than 1/5 of the S&P500, what are practical ways to de-risk your portfolio from this imbalance?","For those who subscribe to having the majority or the entirety of their equity holdings to consist of ETF/funds from the S&P 500, the impact to their portfolio as a function of any one company has increased substantially.

Even with total market funds like Vanguard's VTI, these five stocks make up an outsized portion of the fund because of market cap weight.

"Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) Analysis","Hey Guys whats up, this is my first analysis. I would like to get some feedback on it so give me your thoughts.

# Core Business

Google’s operations are divided in three categories: Google Services, Google Cloud and so called “Other Bets” consisting of several ventures including A.I., robotics, autonomous driving and pharmacy. As Google Services and Google Cloud generate >99% of Google’s revenue I won’t go into much detail on the “Other Bets” Category.

## Relevant Acquisitions

Through it’s acquisition activity google amassed around 250 acquisitions, expanding their research capabilities in fields like A.I., quantum computing and robotics. Below the most important ones are summarized.

**Youtube**

The most famous one of all Google acquisitions. Purchased in 2006 for 1.65 billion dollars Youtube has risen to world wide success and an unchallenged standing almost as relevant as it’s parent company. With revenues as high as 28,8 billion dollars (2021), it generates over 10% of Google’s revenue. It has proven to further expand their earnings-power besides ads with it’s Youtube Premium and Music subscription, which according to Alphabet was the major contributer to an increase of $6.3 billion in Google’s “Other Revenues” (1).

**DoubleClick**

DoubleClick was an ad service provider, who worked with advertising agencies and served major brands like Coca-Cola, GM and Microsoft. After it’s acquisition in 2008 for $3.1 billion lots of customer relations and technology was integrated into Googles ad business. In 2018 Google announced it’s plan to rebrand all ad platforms and merged DoubleClick with Googles own ad platform into the new Google Marketing Platform (2).

**Motorola Mobility**

When Google acquired Motorola in 2011, the company was struggling to gain a foothold in the smartphone business and reported the fifth straight quarter of losses. The company cost $12.5 billion dollar, Google’s largest acquisition, and was motivated as a strategic move to increase Google’s patent ownership and defend the Android operating system. After closing the deal Google sold parts of the business to Arris Group for $2.35 billion and led the smartphone division to success through a focus on high-quality entry-level smartphones. In 2014 Google sold Motorola for $2.91 billion, while keeping a major part of the patents. (3)

**Mandiant**

Google announced that Mandiant would be acquired in March 2022, to get integrated into the Google Cloud division.

**Fitbit**

Fitbit, a producer of wearable technology was acquired by Google in January 2021 and integrated into it’s hardware division.

**Nest Labs**

To expand it’s home automation business Google acquired Nest labs in 2014 for §3.2 billion and merged it with the Google Home brand in 2018 to create Google Nest.

## Industry Enviroment / Competition

**Advertising**

Through it’s search engine and Youtube, Google generates significant revenue with advertisment campaigns for it’s customers. It is unchallenged with a market share of 92% for it’s search engine and Google Chrome leading the browser market with 65% (4). Competition in it’s most relevant business is almost irrelevant for it’s earnings power and market position as most major players (Microsoft with Bing, Yahoo) have failed to attack it.

**Google Cloud**

In the highly competitive cloud computing industry Google competes with giants like Microsoft, Alibaba and Amazon. It isn’t in a leading position, but increased it’s market share from 5% (2017) to 10% (2021) with only AWS and Microsoft Azure above. (5) (6)

## Income Statement

## Revenue Growth

Google’s revenue has increased by an average of 21% annually in the last 10 years. With Growth accelerating in the past 5 years (23,3%), the question should be if similar growth can be expected in the future.

Google’s main business of advertising stands as strong as we have discussed above and with more digitilization and e-commerce growth not slowing down the market for it’s search engine and it’s ads will continue to grow. Growth projections in that business reach from 11% to 15%. (8) (9)

As Google Cloud has gained more market share in the last years and has grown it’s revenue by more than 40% on average, it’s safe to say that it will grow at least as much as the overall cloud computing industry if not more. In a recent market research report a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of over 16% was forecasted until 2026. We will take that at face value for our worst case scenario and will add to it as in a best case scenario, Google will gain more market share. (10)

In recent history Google was able to decrease different parts of it’s costs effectively, thus increasing profitablility. Cost of revenue is made up of \*\*\*\*traffic acquisition costs (TAC) and other revenue costs. **TAC** consists of payments made to traffic distributors, giving Google the platform and audience to advertise for it’s clients.

Other revenue costs consist of licensing fees for **acquired content** sold on YouTube and Google Play, expenses in it’s **data centers** and costs related to Google’s **hardware business**.

**Composition of cost of revenue (COR) (Table 4)**

|Cost in ($ Mio)/Year|2020|2021|
|:-|:-|:-|
|TAC|32,778|45,566|
|Other COR|51,954|65,373|
|Total COR|84,732|110,939|

With past cost development it’s important to use the studied data to make forecasts into the future regarding revenue, cost and profit development to feed our DCF model. We will look for patterns in which relation costs follow growing revenue. With the following table I will try to point that out.

||2013-2014|2014-2015|2015-2016|2016-2017|2017-2018|2018-2019|2019-2020|2020-2021|Average|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue Growth|18,88%|13,62%|20,38%|22,80%|23,42%|18,30%|12,77%|41,15%|21,42%|
|COR|16,81%|9,63%|24,76%|29,73%|30,64%|20,73%|17,85%|30,93%|22,64%|
|R&D|37,76%|24,92%|13,56%|19,19%|28,84%|21,47%|5,98%|14,47%|20,77%|
|Sales and Market|24,06%|11,27%|15,89%|22,97%|26,68%|13,05%|\-2,81%|27,67%|17,35%|
|General&Admin|32,02%|4,87%|13,84%|\-1,62%|18,25%|17,54%|15,72%|22,24%|15,36%|

The cost of revenue has trailed revenue quite close and I expect it to continue to be around 40-43% of all revenue. R&D expenses have risen with revenue but have slown down in recent years. It’s not attached to revenue growth directly, but we will assume a small average growth of 10% for the upcoming years as the R&D expenses are already high enough to guarantee Google to be a potential player in all upcoming high-tech industries. Further reductions in the SGA expenses relative to revenue is possible with revenue outpacing those costs, as it has been seen in the past. Still we will assume it too be just stable to have a more conservative approach.

## Balance Sheet

## Debt Level

Google’s long term debt is almost non-existing with $15 billion. It’s earnings were >$70 billion in 2021 so it’s debt could have been paid off with just 20% of that. The company also hold’s $21 billion in cash, which makes debt for the valuation almost irrelevant.

## Capital Intensity

As Google’s business needs large amounts of land, offices and server infrastructure. Aside from large marketable securities positions, most capital is tied up in purchased land, offices and information technology assets like server farms. The company is determined to expand it’s position in that area, which will result in rising capital expenditures for both new offices and new IT assets. (1)

## Liquidation Value / Tangible Book Value

To calculate the Tangible Book Value I will use the most recent book value and exclude all assets I think are intangible. TBV calculation in $billion:

|Book Value|254,004|
|:-|:-|
|\-Goodwill|\-23,010|
|\-Property and Equipment|\-104,218|
|\-Other non-current assets|\-5,778|
|TBV|120,998|

Note: I didn’t exclude smaller positions as it would make the formular unnecessarilly large with no real effect. It’s also quite reasonable as normally the Property and Equipment of Google of cause could be sold for at least a fraction of the audited value.

Google has a TBV per share of: $120998 million / 673.22 million shares = $179,73 per share

## Cashflow Statement

IT assets generally have a high turnover frequence which results in short depreciating periods (4-5 years). The replacement makes up a large portion of the $24.6 billion of capital expenditures, which are needed for the business operation.

Still Google has great liquidity through it’s short-term marketable securities and it’s large cash reserves.

With almost over $60 billion dollar of free cashflow, Google used most of it ($50 billion) to make stock repurchases. Still the company has only really started to do repurchases in the last 4-5 years and because of it’s high valuation the amount of shares outstanding has only decreased by 5% in 3 years, which is quite a disappointment (11). $15 billion were paid in stock compensation and to account for that we won’t add it back into the DCF-valuation even though it’s a non-cash expense.

## Other

## Insider Trading / Ownership

Insider Trading has no significance for Google as high management only sold insignificant portions of their ownership. (12)

The founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin still have small stakes in the company of around 3% each, even though they slowly continue to sell them off. There is also no insider with a significant stake in the company. (12)

## Risks

* Lower advertising spending by customers
* Google’s value for it’s customers could decline
* Competition disrupting the occupied markets

## DCF Model

Summary of the Assumptions made:

* The revenue of Google Services will increase with the projected growth of the overall market of 11%-15%, which is conservative as parts like Youtube are growing at much higher rates
* Google Cloud’s revenue has increased at an annual growth rate of over 40%. In a worst case scenario it will grow at a CAGR of 16% in line with it’s industry projection, but there is a real possibility of it to accelerate at the current rate until it has gained enough size. Our worst, base and best case projection will still stay conservative at 16%-24$
* As COR is staying volatile around 45% of revenue we will assume it to stay at that level
* R&D will rise around 10% every year unrelated to revenues
* SGA (sales, general, administration) expenses will stay at the current level of 14% relative to revenues and won’t decrease any further
* capital expenses have remained quite stable at around $24 billion dollars. We will still assume an increase of 10% per year as in the most recent 10-Q report the capex has risen by over 40%.
* Depreciation rises at CapEx rate
* 2021 is not an outlier
* Share repurchases will range between 2-5% per year, as those are highly dependent on the share price

We will use a projection of the next 15 years to determine Google’s fair value in 3 scenarios at a **discount rate of 8%**

||Worst Case|Base Case|Best Case|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Google Ads CAGR|11%|13%|15%|
|Google Cloud CAGR|16%|20%|24%|
|COR|45% of total rev|“”|“”|
|R&D CAGR|10%|“”|“”|
|SGA|14% of total rev|“”|""”|
|CapEx and Depreciation|10%|“”|""”|
|Share repurchases|2%|3,5%|5%|
|Fair Value|$1690|$2518|$3805|

I would consider te base case to be highly plausible as past growth has indicated much higher growth rates. Of course it’s up to you to choose your margin of safety, but I will consider to pick up some shares if Google falls below $2000.

The company also hold’s $21 billion in cash, which makes debt for the valuation almost irrelevant. ## Capital Intensity As Google’s business needs large amounts of land, offices and server infrastructure. Aside from large marketable securities positions, most capital is tied up in purchased land, offices and information technology assets like server farms. The company is determined to expand it’s position in that area, which will result in rising capital expenditures for both new offices and new IT assets. (1) ## Liquidation Value / Tangible Book Value To calculate the Tangible Book Value I will use the most recent book value and exclude all assets I think are intangible. TBV calculation in $billion: |Book Value|254,004| |:-|:-| |\-Goodwill|\-23,010| |\-Property and Equipment|\-104,218| |\-Other non-current assets|\-5,778| |TBV|120,998| Note: I didn’t exclude smaller positions as it would make the formular unnecessarilly large with no real effect. It’s also quite reasonable as normally the Property and Equipment of Google of cause could be sold for at least a fraction of the audited value. Google has a TBV per share of: $120998 million / 673.22 million shares = $179,73 per share ## Cashflow Statement IT assets generally have a high turnover frequence which results in short depreciating periods (4-5 years). The replacement makes up a large portion of the $24.6 billion of capital expenditures, which are needed for the business operation. Still Google has great liquidity through it’s short-term marketable securities and it’s large cash reserves. With almost over $60 billion dollar of free cashflow, Google used most of it ($50 billion) to make stock repurchases. Still the company has only really started to do repurchases in the last 4-5 years and because of it’s high valuation the amount of shares outstanding has only decreased by 5% in 3 years, which is quite a disappointment (11). $15 billion were paid in stock compensation and to account for that we won’t add it back into the DCF-valuation even though it’s a non-cash expense. ## Other ## Insider Trading / Ownership Insider Trading has no significance for Google as high management only sold insignificant portions of their ownership. (12) The founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin still have small stakes in the company of around 3% each, even though they slowly continue to sell them off. There is also no insider with a significant stake in the company. (12) ## Risks * Lower advertising spending by customers * Google’s value for it’s customers could decline * Competition disrupting the occupied markets ## DCF Model Summary of the Assumptions made: * The revenue of Google Services will increase with the projected growth of the overall market of 11%-15%, which is conservative as parts like Youtube are growing at much higher rates * Google Cloud’s revenue has increased at an annual growth rate of over 40%. In a worst case scenario it will grow at a CAGR of 16% in line with it’s industry projection, but there is a real possibility of it to accelerate at the current rate until it has gained enough size. Our worst, base and best case projection will still stay conservative at 16%-24$ * As COR is staying volatile around 45% of revenue we will assume it to stay at that level * R&D will rise around 10% every year unrelated to revenues * SGA (sales, general, administration) expenses will stay at the current level of 14% relative to revenues and won’t decrease any further * capital expenses have remained quite stable at around $24 billion dollars. We will still assume an increase of 10% per year as in the most recent 10-Q report the capex has risen by over 40%. * Depreciation rises at CapEx rate * 2021 is not an outlier * Share repurchases will range between 2-5% per year, as those are highly dependent on the share price We will use a projection of the next 15 years to determine Google’s fair value in 3 scenarios at a **discount rate of 8%** ||Worst Case|Base Case|Best Case| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Google Ads CAGR|11%|13%|15%| |Google Cloud CAGR|16%|20%|24%| |COR|45% of total rev|“”|“”| |R&D CAGR|10%|“”|“”| |SGA|14% of total rev|“”|""”| |CapEx and Depreciation|10%|“”|""”| |Share repurchases|2%|3,5%|5%| |Fair Value|$1690|$2518|$3805| I would consider te base case to be highly plausible as past growth has indicated much higher growth rates. Of course it’s up to you to choose your margin of safety, but I will consider to pick up some shares if Google falls below $2000. ## Sources (1) [ (2) [ (3) [ (4) [ (5) [ (6) [ (7) [ (8) [ (9) [ (10) [ (11) [ (12) [",0.08130196413635903,1

$GOOG: Justice Dept. Plans to File Antitrust Charges Against Google in Coming Weeks,"[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/politics/google-antitrust-justice-department.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/politics/google-antitrust-justice-department.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)

Key Excerpts:

&#x200B;

>The Justice Department plans to bring an antitrust case against Google as soon as this month, after Attorney General William P. Barr overruled career lawyers who said they needed more time to build a strong case against one of the world’s wealthiest, most formidable technology companies, according to five people briefed on internal department conversations.  
>  
>Justice Department officials told lawyers involved in the antitrust inquiry into Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, to wrap up their work by the end of September, according to three of the people. Most of the 40-odd lawyers who had been working on the investigation opposed the deadline. Some said they would not sign the complaint, and several of them left the case this summer.

&#x200B;

>Brianna Herlihy, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment on the continuing investigation. Jose Castaneda, a spokesman for Google, said that the company would “continue to engage with ongoing investigations” and that its business practices enabled “increased choice and competition.”

&#x200B;

>The Justice Department amassed powerful evidence of anticompetitive practices, three people said.  
>  
>But the lawyers also described internal politics that at times slowed down the department’s work or drove a wedge among members of the team.

&#x200B;

>For nearly a year, dozens of Justice Department lawyers and other staff members worked in two groups, each overseeing a separate line of inquiry: Google’s dominance in search and its control over many aspects of the ecosystem for online advertising.

&#x200B;

>Google controls about 90 percent of web searches globally, and rivals have complained that the company extended its dominance by making its search and browsing tools defaults on phones with its Android operating system. Google also captures about one-third of every dollar spent on online advertising, and its ad tools are used to supply and auction ads that appear across the internet.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech seems to have picked up with Google in the Trump Administrations crosshairs. Despite broad bipartisan support in Congress and amongst 50 state AGs, there seems to be some politicking, or at least the appearance of such, that could slow down the government's case.

What should Apple do to replace the money they get from Google?,"It is looking like the US DOJ no longer thinks it is OK for Google to pay Apple to be the default search engine on iOS, MacOS, etc.

The most likely resolution will be that the first time you turn on your iPhone you are given a screen with the different search engines in a random list.

You then choose your search engine.  Free to change later but likely most will not.  This will be basically you choosing your default search engine.

Obviously this would be very bad for Apple.  Today, Apple sells the access to their customers and Google has been reported to pay Apple over $15 billion per year.  Some estimate over $20 billion.

I believe this is going to be the toughest decision yet needed to be made by Tim Cook.   He could have Apple try to create their own search engine and then sell advertising with the new Apple search engine to try to replace the lost revenue.

Talking with my dad about Nvidia over Thanksgiving,"My dad is an active investor, has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.

The knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the ""other stuff"" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their ""AI hardware"" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \*literally\* the same thing.

They didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.

This came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.

As to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.

Before all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they've been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use-cases (e.g. tensor-cores) and they're not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data-center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards.

I don't mean to discount their good work, they've done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible, there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck.

"7 years from $0 to $100k, 3 years from $100k to $200k","I joined eTrade in 2013 a few years after graduating college. I had set up automatic monthly contributions to my accounts, which I slowly raised over time and mostly invested in blue chip stocks. 

On December 1, 2020, the combined value of my Roth and Traditional Brokerage account was just over $100k. It took me over seven years to get there and was a major milestone.  In the past three years, I have raised my monthly contributions, continued to invest, and am now just shy of $200k at the age of 35. You read about the power of compound gains all the time, but to go from $100k to $200k in three years when the first $100k took seven years is a testiment to that fact.  My goal is $1 mil by 47 and eventually to hit $2.5 mil before I retire. 

For all you youngins out there, stick with it! But also, don't rush the process and try to hit home runs every day. For the most part, I am a buy and hold investor after a year or two of trying my hand at day trading with options and futures. When you chase the money, you won't make it. But if you’re patient with a decent risk tolerance, anything is possible. 



Edit: Wow, thanks for the up votes everyone. It’s been fun reading the comments. Adding some context here based on some of the questions that have come in. Monthly contributions are at $1,000 a month now, but in the early years they were less. When I first started, it was $100 a month and I worked my way up from there. There was a good chunk of time where they were between $200-$500 a month. These accounts were set up on my own, no employer match. I’m not sure what my lifetime performance is, but the last three years I’m up 30% overall. All that in mind, I can confidently say that well over half of my account is due to investment gains. 

Investments have been all individual stocks that I typically hold for a year or longer. I pick them based on both technical and fundamental factors. This is more risky than ETFs and index funds but it suits my investing style and risk tolerance. I try to stick to profitable companies with a stock price that has a history of moving in the right direction, however I also like to buy at a discount price. I keep my eyes on charts and when there’s opportunities to buy at historically undervalued prices I jump on it. There’s really nothing super special to it. Not going to share my current exact portfolio, but stocks I have owned in the past or currently include AAPL, GOOGL, META, COST, HD, MCD, DKNG, AMD, DIS, and BAC to name a few. There are many others I’m interested in buying that are on my watchlist.

I will also add that I’ve made a ton of mistakes along the way. Bad investments, selling too soon when I should of just held, taking risky, over leveraged day trades that resulted in nasty losses and wash sales. However, I’ve learned from them and never done anything bad enough that blew an account or resulted in a draw down that couldn’t be recovered. You can read all the books you want but I’ve always found that the best way is to learn by doing and over time you develop your own skills and are able to trust your own analysis and decisions.",investing,Google,"7 years from $0 to $100k, 3 years from $100k to $200k I joined eTrade in 2013 a few years after graduating college.

$GOOGL Google is in a big trouble in the long run - here is why.,"Let's do the math directly and take a look at Google ads results in 2023:

- The revenue generated by Google ads in 2023 is $237 billion.

- The revenue portion from Google search engine is around 60%!!! That means out of the $237 billion, around $142 billion revenue is generated from the search engine or search ads.

- Google's total revenue for 2023 was $305 billion, that means the revenue from the search engine only (not entire Google ads) makes around 45% of Google's total revenue.

Now the second search engine behind Google is Microsoft Bing, Microsoft generated in 2023 only $12 Billion from Bing ads.

Google by far is the dominant as for now, and Microsoft although in the second place behind them, won't be able to reach even a quarter of Google's revenue, they had many failed attempts to promote Bing.

Now some of you probably heared about the upcoming releases of SearchGPT, whoever tried ChatGPT will know it's by far better than Gemini and the other AI models, if Openai released their SearchGPT and people switched from Google search to SearchGPT (which I personally think will happen), Google in this case will keep 45% of its total revenue vulnerable by SearchGPT.

TL;DR Google have strong exposure to its search engine, the revenue generated from the search engine is around 45% of its total revenue, with the upcoming release of SearchGPT, Google may lose its dominance in the long term which may cause their revenue growth to stop or decline.

Let's do the math directly and take a look at Google ads results in 2023: - The revenue generated by Google ads in 2023 is $237 billion. - The revenue portion from Google search engine is around 60%!!! That means out of the $237 billion, around $142 billion revenue is generated from the search engine or search ads. - Google's total revenue for 2023 was $305 billion, that means the revenue from the search engine only (not entire Google ads) makes around 45% of Google's total revenue. Now the second search engine behind Google is Microsoft Bing, Microsoft generated in 2023 only $12 Billion from Bing ads. Google by far is the dominant as for now, and Microsoft although in the second place behind them, won't be able to reach even a quarter of Google's revenue, they had many failed attempts to promote Bing. Now some of you probably heared about the upcoming releases of SearchGPT, whoever tried ChatGPT will know it's by far better than Gemini and the other AI models, if Openai released their SearchGPT and people switched from Google search to SearchGPT (which I personally think will happen), Google in this case will keep 45% of its total revenue vulnerable by SearchGPT. TL;DR Google have strong exposure to its search engine, the revenue generated from the search engine is around 45% of its total revenue, with the upcoming release of SearchGPT, Google may lose its dominance in the long term which may cause their revenue growth to stop or decline.

During his time at Yahoo, the company's search market share PLUMMETED from 30.4% to 13.4%. Yeah, you read that right - it was a FREE FALL. And it's not like he was just a bystander, he was in charge of research and development for Yahoo's search and ads products. But wait, it gets better. Under his leadership, Yahoo's search market share DECLINED FOR 9 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS.
And to top it all off, Yahoo had its LARGEST LAYOFFS IN CORPORATE HISTORY at the time, cutting nearly 2,000 jobs.
Is this a risk to GOOG long-term healthy growth? Have they started prioritizing short-term ad revenue over user experience, flooding search results with spam and ads to inflate earnings? Are we seeing a repeat of Yahoo's mistakes?

The permanent layoffs are coming from Santa Clara and San Francisco County.  Typically, layoffs are bullish, but I speculate that in this case, it is **Very** **Bullish**.

Why?

# AI.

See: [ChatGPT Passes Google Coding Interview for Level 3 Engineer With $183K Salary](https://www.pcmag.com/news/chatgpt-passes-google-coding-interview-for-level-3-engineer-with-183k-salary)

That's right.  Your favorite fucking slur word against bears when they make complete sense about overvaluation and bubbles and what-not.  I spek-ulate these positions will be replaced by AI, and the $183,000 engineering salary for these high cost of living areas will be put back in the pocket of the company.  Multiply that by 701 employees getting the boot, and that is $128,283,000 saved and put onto the market cap of the company, which isn't a lot, but we are just getting started with integration.  I know that is outrageously optimistic and there are sure to be HR staff, Graphic Artists, DEI Leaders, Janitors, and whatever other clowns that google has hired among some of the top salaries in the country.

Instead of losing manpower however, it is being replaced by a more agile technology that has a much lower operating cost.  This is what makes it different than your average layoff of a bloated employee pool.

Also,  What they did not disclose to the government is they have began laying off contractors in oregon for the Youtube Music Side of things.  The massive amount of subtitle work for every youtube song and podcast can now be automated.

I'm marking it as a discussion not DD since I feel it's a fairly simple strategy.

Also, if you work for google in these counties, sorry you had to hear it from me instead of a Sunday morning text saying don't come to work anymore.

"GOOGLE: The Real Leader In AI, Robotics and Self Driving ","This is a follow up  post to my analysis of TESLA VS WAYMO. 


Right now OpenAI is the clear leader when it comes to developing AI. Everyone else is playing catch up, however there's one company that doesn't get enough credit - GOOGLE. 


Google is the one that actually did most of the groundbreaking work in AI. They're the pioneers of technology in the field of AI. 


You must be thinking Why didn't we hear about this if they're the pioneers of AI? 


The reason is that Google failed to be the first one to commercialise it. 

Google had something called ""PROJECT MOONSHOTS.""  It was basically a division of Google solely focused on Ultra Ambitious Projects. 

AI research and development was a part of it.

In 2014 Google acquired DeepMind Labs that was founded in the UK in 2010.

DeepMind introduced neural Turing machines (neural networks that can access external memory like a conventional Turing machine), which is basically a computer that loosely resembles short-term memory in the human brain.


The Founding Research and Development Team of OpenAI, actually came from Google (DeepMind).


Now going back to ""PROJECT MOONSHOTS"" - in 2010 Larry Page and Sergy Brin turned  ""Project Moonshots"" into ""X COMPANY"".

Yes, it's called X, and they did it before Musk LMAO. 

This is what X Company does -

X's mission is to invent and launch ""moonshot"" technologies that aim to make the world a radically better place.

 A moonshot is defined by X as the intersection of a big problem, a radical solution, and breakthrough technology. 

Work at X is overseen by entrepreneur scientist Astro Teller, as CEO and ""Captain of Moonshots"".

The lab started with the development of Google's self-driving car.


SELF DRIVING VEHICLES are a brainchild of X Company. 

They are also working on some secret projects (presumably alongside the US government).


While Google fell behind OpenAI in commercializing and marketing of AI, they are still a leader in everything related to AI, Machine Learning and Fully Autonomous Vehicles. 


. . . . . . .


TLDR;

GOOGLE IS EVERYTHING ELON MUSK IS CLAIMING TO BE.

EDIT 1 : My Thoughts On DOJ Case Against Google and A Potential Breakup 


If (a big if) DOJ actually wins against Google and is able to break them up, the most likely scenario is a spin-off of Android and Chrome. 

IMO, this is not a bad thing if you're looking at the bigger picture. It will get DOJ/Anti-trust lawsuits worldwide off Google's back, without really impairing their ability to develop AI and other futuristic tech.


Even this can potentially take years to materialize, if it ever actually happens. So personally I'm not bothered by it.

The permanent layoffs are coming from Santa Clara and San Francisco County.  Typically, layoffs are bullish, but I speculate that in this case, it is **Very** **Bullish**.

Why?

# AI.

See: [ChatGPT Passes Google Coding Interview for Level 3 Engineer With $183K Salary](https://www.pcmag.com/news/chatgpt-passes-google-coding-interview-for-level-3-engineer-with-183k-salary)

That's right.  Your favorite fucking slur word against bears when they make complete sense about overvaluation and bubbles and what-not.  I spek-ulate these positions will be replaced by AI, and the $183,000 engineering salary for these high cost of living areas will be put back in the pocket of the company.  Multiply that by 701 employees getting the boot, and that is $128,283,000 saved and put onto the market cap of the company, which isn't a lot, but we are just getting started with integration.  I know that is outrageously optimistic and there are sure to be HR staff, Graphic Artists, DEI Leaders, Janitors, and whatever other clowns that google has hired among some of the top salaries in the country.

Instead of losing manpower however, it is being replaced by a more agile technology that has a much lower operating cost.  This is what makes it different than your average layoff of a bloated employee pool.

Also,  What they did not disclose to the government is they have began laying off contractors in oregon for the Youtube Music Side of things.  The massive amount of subtitle work for every youtube song and podcast can now be automated.

I'm marking it as a discussion not DD since I feel it's a fairly simple strategy.

Also, if you work for google in these counties, sorry you had to hear it from me instead of a Sunday morning text saying don't come to work anymore.

What's up with Google?,"Google is not participating in this AI rally and we are all left wondering why. In fact it just did a double top with its 2021/22 high and  is down 15% already.  


Back in 2017, some Google researchers wrote a paper that changed the game of AI forever. It was called ""Attention is all you need"" and it introduced a new way of building AI models using something called Transformers (no not that one).

"For the love of god, google ""Kelly Criterion""","It doesn't matter if you are 99% sure that your YOLO will moon because of the transit of Uranus or something. It's heartbreaking to see people posting losses amounting to years of savings, I was also seriously considering a YOLO on long SPY puts until I came across this concept because I'm feeling super sure about a pending recession. Read up on it and I am converted, I'll maybe make a sizeable bet of like 10% but I ain't going all in (at that point it's basically a hedge).

The gist is the best way to make money over time is to sensibly size your capital allocation to any bet you make, statistically you will come out better off. Even if a bet has a 99% chance of doubling your investment it doesn't make sense to bet your entire port because if you hit that 1% you're fucked. Think of it as playing Russian Roulette with a revolver with 100 barrels (YOLOing), vs.... I don't know, some equivalent situation but if the bet doesn't go your way you just get punched in the face really hard (sizeable allocation but not a YOLO). Not even accounting for the fact most of this shit has odds sub 10%, not to mention you probably don't understand options correctly and will lose even if what you think will happen to the underlying happens.

If you bet 10% on something that moons, you made great gains! Enviable gains even. Don't risk having to leave the table entirely and impacting your future because you FOMO your entire port on something.

"You missed META, NFLX, GOOGL? Try AAPL","I think AAPL is an obvious play. It hasn't participated in this 2024 rally at all and is due for a catch-up play. Two main reasons why AAPL has been lagging: slowing growth (mainly China) and lack of AI hype. The slowing growth is priced into the stock. Earnings expectations are already low for AAPL.  

AAPL reminds me of GOOGL this year when it was in similar situation of dumpster fire but then broke out after it finally worked out Gemini.

We need to see some sort of hype and the market needs to be convinced that that the next iphone will be a must-have due its new AI features.

The whole kitchen sink was thrown at AAPL recently. You have dissapointing product launch of its Vision Pro. You have the news about negative China sales. You have this big DOJ case come out of no where. You had an analyst downgrade yesterday. And even with all of that, it didn't make a new low from March 6th. Unless there's an unexpected market-wide correction, I can't see AAPL going lower this year.

This whole market recently has been a rotation trade. That is why the market has gone up even without AAPL and now without NVDA. The market has been broadening.

"GOOGLE: The Real Leader In AI, Robotics and Self Driving ","This is a follow up  post to my analysis of TESLA VS WAYMO. 


Right now OpenAI is the clear leader when it comes to developing AI. Everyone else is playing catch up, however there's one company that doesn't get enough credit - GOOGLE. 


Google is the one that actually did most of the groundbreaking work in AI. They're the pioneers of technology in the field of AI. 


You must be thinking Why didn't we hear about this if they're the pioneers of AI? 


The reason is that Google failed to be the first one to commercialise it. 

Google had something called ""PROJECT MOONSHOTS.""  It was basically a division of Google solely focused on Ultra Ambitious Projects. 

AI research and development was a part of it.

In 2014 Google acquired DeepMind Labs that was founded in the UK in 2010.

DeepMind introduced neural Turing machines (neural networks that can access external memory like a conventional Turing machine), which is basically a computer that loosely resembles short-term memory in the human brain.


The Founding Research and Development Team of OpenAI, actually came from Google (DeepMind).


Now going back to ""PROJECT MOONSHOTS"" - in 2010 Larry Page and Sergy Brin turned  ""Project Moonshots"" into ""X COMPANY"".

Yes, it's called X, and they did it before Musk LMAO. 

This is what X Company does -

X's mission is to invent and launch ""moonshot"" technologies that aim to make the world a radically better place.

 A moonshot is defined by X as the intersection of a big problem, a radical solution, and breakthrough technology. 

Work at X is overseen by entrepreneur scientist Astro Teller, as CEO and ""Captain of Moonshots"".

The lab started with the development of Google's self-driving car.


SELF DRIVING VEHICLES are a brainchild of X Company. 

They are also working on some secret projects (presumably alongside the US government).


While Google fell behind OpenAI in commercializing and marketing of AI, they are still a leader in everything related to AI, Machine Learning and Fully Autonomous Vehicles. 


. . . . . . .


TLDR;

GOOGLE IS EVERYTHING ELON MUSK IS CLAIMING TO BE.

EDIT 1 : My Thoughts On DOJ Case Against Google and A Potential Breakup 


If (a big if) DOJ actually wins against Google and is able to break them up, the most likely scenario is a spin-off of Android and Chrome. 

IMO, this is not a bad thing if you're looking at the bigger picture. It will get DOJ/Anti-trust lawsuits worldwide off Google's back, without really impairing their ability to develop AI and other futuristic tech.


Even this can potentially take years to materialize, if it ever actually happens. So personally I'm not bothered by it.
