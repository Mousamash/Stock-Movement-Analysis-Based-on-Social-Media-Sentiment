Best strategy for investing in SPY:,"I decided to explore this by testing three different strategies for contributing funds to a portfolio over 10 years to try to determine whether it's better to invest a lump sum at the start of the year, spread contributions evenly across months, or invest incrementally each trading day. Here's how it played out.

**The Strategies**

1. **Yearly Lump Sum**: Investing $10,000 at the beginning of each year.
2. **Monthly Investment**: Breaking $10,000 into 12 equal parts ($833.33) and investing at the start of each month.
3. **Daily Investment**: Spreading $10,000 evenly across all trading days in a year.

**Overall Results (End of 2024)**

* **Yearly Lump Sum**: $53,461, with an overall cumulative return of **\~434.6%**.
* **Monthly Investment**: $51,435, with an overall cumulative return of **\~414.4%**.
* **Daily Investment**: $51,446, with an overall cumulative return of **\~414.5%**.

After conducting a 20-year test comparing three popular investment strategies—lump-sum investing, monthly contributions, and daily contributions—I found that the yearly lump-sum strategy provided the highest overall returns. At first glance, this might seem like a definitive answer to the perennial question of how to invest for the best outcome. But the more I analyzed the results, the more I began to question whether the data truly tells the whole story.

EDIT:

my resaerch was completely wrong and goes to show that AI is only as good as the data that you put into it. These are the final results after some tweaks:  
  
**Yearly Lump Sum**: $163,573.96

**Monthly Investment:** $180,559.47

**Weekly Investment:** $182,003.40

**Daily Investment:** $131,120.43

Weekly and Monthly Investment Strategies strike the best balance between risk mitigation and compounding growth. While the Lump Sum Strategy benefits from early exposure in bull markets, it is more susceptible to downturns. The Daily Strategy, despite reducing timing risk, suffers from delayed compounding and is less effective over time.","Best strategy for investing in SPY: I decided to explore this by testing three different strategies for contributing funds to a portfolio over 10 years to try to determine whether it's better to invest a lump sum at the start of the year, spread contributions evenly across months, or invest incrementally each trading day.

What is the investment thesis for the space sector?,"Over the last few years, I've seen increased interest in space as an investment theme. While I understand broadly what satellites enable us to do on Earth, what minerals we might be able to extract from the moon, or how cool (and perhaps even essential) it would be to establish a colony on Mars, I've never really understood the investment thesis.

I can see why governments would want to research space and even expand their space presence for defense purposes. But on the private side, where does profit come from?

If you're bullish on the space sector, I'd love to hear your brief investment thesis and which companies you consider most promising.","What is the investment thesis for the space sector?

SMCI Recovery and loose DD ,"SMCI golden age and beautiful chart. 

After hours Friday SMCI jumped almost 9 percent! Makes perfect sense that investors are flooding back into this stock! It has been so beaten down over the last six months by bad press and fears of fraud. Those fears have been quelled by a new CFO and auditing team. 

We just saw in the last month of 72% rally and there is still plenty of room to run on Monday it will open up around $48, the last critical level we saw was $49.

Also, it looks like a somewhat sloppy cup and handle pattern is forming. My half baked technical analysis is. We will see a minor pull back around $50 to finish the pattern, then it will launch back up to the next critical level around $60 a share. 

Fundamentally speaking, they have been showing plenty of growth and demand for their products which mainly consists of hardware to House semiconductors, especially their trademark marked water cooled rack, which directly addresses a huge issue that centers are facing as computing power gets to Skynet levels. Their price to earnings ratio is a modest 21.9, the earnings per share is a humble 2, the ps ratio is 1.5 which is the lowest among its competitors. In fact all of its metrics or lowest amongst its competitors except for the EPS for AMD, which is 1.1. 

There will be much to see within the next quarterly earnings report and how they managed to address their auditing issues and reporting issues. But I think this company still has room to run and definitely has legs.

I have 200 shares with plans to buy much more. I was going to buy on the next red day, expecting it to be Monday, but I digress. Next pull back I’m buying calls with a strike price of about $49-$55 exp in March.","SMCI Recovery and loose DD SMCI golden age and beautiful chart. After hours Friday SMCI jumped almost 9 percent!

Help understanding JBT merger,"I recently inherited a retirement brokerage account, which I've never owned before, so I've been crash course educating myself about it. The vast majority of it is made up of ETFs and mutual funds, with the exception of one lone stock, JBT. John Bean Technologies. Currently own about 21 shares.


From my understanding it's a long term hold stock, and has done rather well. I wasn't really planning on touching it anytime soon, but recently JBT has filed to merge with another company, Marel (the latter merging into JBT from my understanding).

Ratings now list it as very Bearish and Sell, but I'd like to know why and what this kind of merger can mean. 

Still learning about all of this. I know not to take the ratings at face value, but I don't know yet how to spot potential red flags so I don't want to just ignore it.

Appreciate any insight.

Decades of Backtesting: Insights That Changed How I Invest,"
Benjamin Graham once said, “Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike.” This quote inspired me to design an investment strategy that mirrors the due diligence and rigor of buying a private business. Instead of relying on trends or speculation, I sought to focus on key factors that truly drive long-term value. These include growth per share, creditworthiness, return on invested capital (ROIC), and shareholder payout. By integrating these metrics into a systematic framework, I aimed to build a strategy that’s rooted in solid business fundamentals.

The Composite Growth Strategy

The framework of my Composite Growth Strategy evaluates companies based on eight critical areas that mimic how you might analyze a private business acquisition:

	1.	Growth Per Share
Focuses on per-share growth in sales, free cash flow, operating cash flow, and gross profit to ensure that growth benefits shareholders directly.

	2.	Absolute Growth
Measures overall growth in gross profit, sales, operating cash flow, and free cash flow, emphasizing strong financial performance.

	3.	Creditworthiness
Evaluates financial stability by analyzing metrics like cash relative to short-term debt, debt coverage through cash flow, and interest expense as a percentage of sales.

	4.	Low Dilution
Prioritizes companies that avoid diluting shareholders by controlling the growth of outstanding shares.

	5.	Intangible Monetization
Assesses how effectively a company utilizes intangible assets, such as intellectual property and goodwill, to generate profits and cash flow.

	6.	Retained ROIC Composite
Measures how well a company reinvests profits into its business, ensuring efficient use of capital to create long-term value.

	7.	Raw ROIC Composite
Analyzes profitability relative to invested capital, focusing on returns generated from gross profit, operating cash flow, and operating income.

	8.	Shareholder Payout
Examines how companies reward shareholders through dividends, buybacks, and consistent increases in payout over time.

Backtesting Results

To validate this strategy, I used backtesting software adjusted for look-ahead bias, spanning data from 2001 to the present. Stocks were ranked every four weeks based on the Composite Growth Strategy, with rankings from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest).

The results demonstrated a clear trend:

	•	The top-ranked stocks (quantile 10) achieved an annualized excess return of 4.72% over the benchmark.

	•	Conversely, the lowest-ranked stocks (quantile 1) underperformed by -7.81% annually.

	•	Quantiles in between showed a consistent gradient, with performance improving as rankings increased.

Chart in link below

This illustrates that the metrics used in the Composite Growth Strategy not only identify high-quality businesses but also consistently add value over time.

Final Thoughts

This strategy was born from the idea of treating stock selection with the same rigor as buying a private business. By focusing on fundamental metrics like growth, ROIC, and shareholder payouts, it aims to identify companies that compound value over time.

Alex Karp: -37,000,000 shares

Stanley Drukenmiller: -729,000 shares

Can Wayfair’s New Loyalty Strategy Drive Growth Along with Inevitable Rate Cuts? ,"First let’s get this out the way, Wayfair did see a 30% jump last month, I think this is moreso in anticipation of lowering rates, as of Q3 this yr Wayfair is still reporting a loss currently, I still think they have room to grow.

We don’t need to dive into this piece too deep, but if rates were to lower from highs which they inevitably will home buying goes up and so too does purchases for furniture. Even if there’s customers that think Wayfair is cheap it’s hard to say that they won’t see growth in revenue. So we know revenue will likely grow, which is great but there’s still a negative bottom line.

Wayfair management recently announced some sort of “loyalty program”. You pay an annual fee and you get discounts (which in a scenario where there’s tariffs that raise prices this might help offset some of those costs to the customer). On a surface level you would think this would hurt bottom lines, but there’s a few catches with this. 

For one, management expects those loyal customers who buy an average of two pieces a year will increase to 3 pieces a year, additionally, with 40% of gross profit being spent on advertising, they think they can cut costs by limiting ads where maybe it doesn’t show to a loyal customer who visits Wayfair anyways when looking for furniture. Lastly it’s a small revenue driver but at $29/year the membership cost is so low where it makes that decision to buy a membership that much easier. 

I like the idea since it seems like it’s trying to tackle an efficiency problem in their spending, and tariff wise could offset SOME of the price increases that may make a customer think twice about a purchase. What’s everyone else’s thoughts? Does this stock have more to drop, and do you think this idea could work?



","Can Wayfair’s New Loyalty Strategy Drive Growth Along with Inevitable Rate Cuts? First let’s get this out the way, Wayfair did see a 30% jump last month, I think this is moreso in anticipation of lowering rates, as of Q3 this yr Wayfair is still reporting a loss currently, I still think they have room to grow. We don’t need to dive into this piece too deep, but if rates were to lower from highs which they inevitably will home buying goes up and so too does purchases for furniture. Even if there’s customers that think Wayfair is cheap it’s hard to say that they won’t see growth in revenue.

Best way to establish a short position on MSTR?,"I have strong conviction that MSTR will collapse at some point. It's a speculative bubble based on BTC (another ""asset"" for which I hold low regard, but that's another point entirely). However, I have much less confidence in my ability to predict when this collapse will occur, and I'm aware that the market can stay irrational longer than I can stay solvent. I don't intend for my short position to take more than 1% of my portfolio.

How can I learn more about the best way to short an overpriced security? Right now, it's MSTR, although I'd be interested in the future as well. I'm aware of the following:

* Regular shorting: I'm very hesitant given the possibility of short squeezes with these meme stocks, although I'm trying to calculate how much of this risk is already priced into the other options.
* Put option: Safer, although this is priced into the premium and time decay, which is really expensive for these stocks.
* Inverse daily ETFs: These are simpler to understand on a surface level, although the underlying financial magic that makes them possible is much more complicated. Unfortunately, the only available ones I've found are 2x inverse daily ETFs, which makes this even more volatile and less susceptible to holding longer.

Would it be practical to calculate how expensive these three options are to each other? Or does this require an actual quantitative analyst?","Best way to establish a short position on MSTR?

"November's job report shows that nonfarm payrolls are better than expected, with a minimal slight rise in the expected unemployment rate.","**This job report shows that nonfarm payroll is better than expected and on track with a soft landing. However, the unemployment rate is slightly lower than expected. Thus, the Fed still has to work on preventing economic contraction by utilizing the interest rate drops to stimulate the economy. This November report is a great year-end gift for the overall stock market with its combination of a soft landing and the expected interest rate cuts until the latter part of 2025 providing the proper ingredients for the market to propel forward.  It will nurture a healthy financial environment that supports lending with low default rates, loosened monetary policies, lower corporate tax, shifting of sideline money into equities, and increased corporate spending for further economic growth.**

Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 227,000 in November, and the unemployment rate changed little at 4.2 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Employment trended up in health care, leisure and hospitality, government, and social assistance. Retail trade lost jobs.

* Nonfarm payrolls: +227,000 vs. +215,000 expected
* Unemployment rate: 4.2% vs. 4.1% expected

There's still inflation hurting shoppers' spending; not buying the argument that all is good now because holiday payrolls are up and retail CEOs are hyping up their holiday sales expectations.

Rumble (RUM) presents a good case to ride the wave of alternative media,"Rumble (RUM) represents a compelling investment opportunity as the leading alternative video platform positioned to capitalize on growing distrust in mainstream media and Big Tech censorship.

Many of the more interesting cases such as Substack are not public, but Rumble is and should be a good opportunity as Youtube is increasingly strict with its moderation and monetization.

With Trump's return to the presidency likely to amplify alternative media consumption, combined with Rumble's 105% YoY revenue growth and expanding user base of 44M monthly active users, the platform is well-positioned to capture market share from YouTube. The company's strong cash position of $242.5M and strategic cloud infrastructure investments provide runway for continued growth while reducing dependency on traditional tech giants.

Bull Case:

1. Growth Trajectory

* Revenue grew 105% YoY from $39.4M (2022) to $81M (2023)
* Historical growth shows impressive scaling: $4.5M (2020) → $9.5M (2021) → $39.4M (2022) → $81M (2023)
* Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of roughly 168% from 2020-2023

1. Political Tailwinds

* Alternative media platforms likely to see increased engagement during election cycles
* Content creator migration from YouTube due to perceived censorship
* Trump presidency could drive conservative audience growth

1. Competitive Advantages

* Cloud infrastructure buildout reduces dependency on Big Tech
* Less restrictive content policies attract creators seeking monetization alternatives
* Strategic partnerships with Truth Social and other conservative platforms

1. Financial Position & Considerations

* Growing revenue demonstrates market validation
* Operating loss of $142.7M TTM reflects heavy investment in infrastructure
* Negative gross margins (-$57.8M TTM) indicate need for scale optimization
* EPS of -$0.65 shows company is in growth/investment phase

Risks to consider:

* Widening operating losses
* High cash burn rate
* Negative gross margins need addressing
* Cost of revenue ($143.5M TTM) exceeding total revenue
* Competition from established platforms","Rumble (RUM) presents a good case to ride the wave of alternative media Rumble (RUM) represents a compelling investment opportunity as the leading alternative video platform positioned to capitalize on growing distrust in mainstream media and Big Tech censorship.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

"Waymo to expand to Miami, aims to launch robotaxi service there in 2026","Waymo is setting its sights on its next location: the Sunshine State.

The Alphabet-owned company announced Thursday that it will be hitting the roads in Miami. Waymo said it will first begin cruising through the Florida city with human safety drivers in 2025 before opening doors to riders for its robotaxi service through its Waymo One app in 2026.

The expansion into Miami is indicative of Waymo’s growing confidence in operating its self-driving vehicles in harsher weather conditions in large metropolitan areas in the U.S.

Waymo first tested in Miami in 2019, which the company said helped improve the ability of its self-driving vehicles to navigate in wet and rainy conditions.

“We deepened our learning and understanding of the Waymo Driver’s performance in adverse weather conditions,” a company spokesperson said.

Waymo will use what it learned when it returns to the city with its all-electric Jaguar I-PACEs next year.

The company said its initial territory in Florida will include some parts of Miami’s larger metropolitan area, which has a population of more than 6 million people.

Waymo has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.

In November, the company announced it was removing its waitlist of about 300,000 people in Los Angeles, so anyone would be able to use Waymo One to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout the nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County. The company’s ride-hailing service also operates citywide in Phoenix and San Francisco.

And in September, Waymo announced a partnership with Uber in Austin and Atlanta. Through that deal, Uber riders will be able to access Waymo’s robotaxis through the Uber app starting in early 2025, and Uber will be responsible for fleet management and operations of the Waymo vehicles, including maintenance and infrastructure, such as vehicle charging, cleaning and repairs. 

Additionally, Waymo on Thursday announced that it will partner with mobility company Moove to manage its fleet operations, facilities and charging infrastructure in both Miami and Phoenix. Moove will begin managing Waymo’s Phoenix fleet in early 2025, a Waymo spokesperson said. 

Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture’s parent company, Alphabet, which also owns Google, led the funding round alongside earlier backers, including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.

The robotaxi company said it now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week via the Waymo One app across San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles. 

Waymo is the only autonomous vehicle developer that currently operates a commercial robotaxi service in several major metro areas across the U.S., but competitors are looming. 

GM-owned Cruise is working on bringing its autonomous vehicles back into use on public roads after discontinuing its services following an accident where one of its self-driving cars injured a pedestrian in San Francisco. 

Tesla, meanwhile, showed off design concepts for a self-driving Cybercab and Robovan at an event in October. However, Tesla still classifies the Autopilot and Full Self-Driving software in its vehicles as “partially automated driving systems,” which require a human to be ready to steer or brake at all times. In an October earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in California and Texas as early as 2025.

SoftBank-funded Wayve is testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, and Amazon-owned Zoox is also testing its self-driving cars, which do not feature steering wheels, in several U.S. cities.

The company said its initial territory in Florida will include some parts of Miami’s larger metropolitan area, which has a population of more than 6 million people. Waymo has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding. In November, the company announced it was removing its waitlist of about 300,000 people in Los Angeles, so anyone would be able to use Waymo One to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout the nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County. The company’s ride-hailing service also operates citywide in Phoenix and San Francisco. And in September, Waymo announced a partnership with Uber in Austin and Atlanta. Through that deal, Uber riders will be able to access Waymo’s robotaxis through the Uber app starting in early 2025, and Uber will be responsible for fleet management and operations of the Waymo vehicles, including maintenance and infrastructure, such as vehicle charging, cleaning and repairs. Additionally, Waymo on Thursday announced that it will partner with mobility company Moove to manage its fleet operations, facilities and charging infrastructure in both Miami and Phoenix. Moove will begin managing Waymo’s Phoenix fleet in early 2025, a Waymo spokesperson said. Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture’s parent company, Alphabet, which also owns Google, led the funding round alongside earlier backers, including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price. The robotaxi company said it now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week via the Waymo One app across San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles. Waymo is the only autonomous vehicle developer that currently operates a commercial robotaxi service in several major metro areas across the U.S., but competitors are looming. GM-owned Cruise is working on bringing its autonomous vehicles back into use on public roads after discontinuing its services following an accident where one of its self-driving cars injured a pedestrian in San Francisco. Tesla, meanwhile, showed off design concepts for a self-driving Cybercab and Robovan at an event in October. However, Tesla still classifies the Autopilot and Full Self-Driving software in its vehicles as “partially automated driving systems,” which require a human to be ready to steer or brake at all times. In an October earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in California and Texas as early as 2025. SoftBank-funded Wayve is testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, and Amazon-owned Zoox is also testing its self-driving cars, which do not feature steering wheels, in several U.S. cities.

Many stocks still down 50-90% from 2021 highs. ,"Lately I have been sifting through a lot of stocks that reached outrageous highs in 2021 and have since fallen back down to earth, and are now sitting at abysmal lows. In my opinion, some of these companies have been overly sold and seemingly forgotten about. 

Some companies on my list are ROKU, ETSY, RIVN, ZM, MNMD. I am still researching these companies, and may open a position with 1 or 2 of them. These companies revenues are climbing, a couple have PEs in the 30s, and they all have a very strong brand. 

I am not totally sold on any of them, but just finding it wild how that their valuations were once 5X-10X higher just a few years ago, and not all that much has changed business wise. 

Open to some criticism about the stocks I listed. But would really like to hear about stocks that have suffered a similar fate, but in your opinion, is completely unwarranted. 

I think a lot of the aggressive selling off was very warranted and healthy after 2021, but some of it may have been over done. 

Would love to hear your thoughts on this! 

Edit: Downvoting because I mentioned a stock you lost money on doesn’t help anyone. I am trying to find good opportunities.","Many stocks still down 50-90% from 2021 highs.

After spending good amount of time talking about their 'AI Studio', there isn't  a very direct answer on FCF either, in their Earnings call:

Brent Bracelin

> Helpful color there, Sonalee for you. I know it's early and really look forward to hearing more about the cost rationalization plan, but you do have a bogey here for Q4. Can you walk us through the path to positive free cash flow? I asked because there was an $18 million burn here in Q3 and I'm just trying to think through the rationalization and ability to get to positive free cash flow here in Q4.

Sonalee Parekh, CFO Asana

> Yes, sure. So as you saw, there was some positive movement on sales and marketing and R&D spend in the current quarter. And part of that actually was due to the timing of some of our hiring. But we do expect to get a continued benefit there, again in terms of timing of hires, which is helpful. And then secondly, there are steps we've already started taking around some rationalization of spend, third party spend, which you should see come into Q4. But what I would really urge you to do is Q4. We've reiterated the positive free cash flow, but I think where you'll really start to see the meaningful improvements in operating margin and cash flow is as you look ahead to next year, where we'll provide more detail in March.

Dustin Moskovitz, CEO

> And this is Dustin. I just wanted to add on to that. I mean, we're really looking at, free cash flow is always a little bit lumpy. So we're really looking at the progress on the operational leverage and how things trend from here into next year. So feel good about Q4, but the real goal is to build up a margin through next year, not to just arrive at the free cash flow.

TSMC in talks with Nvidia for AI chip production in Arizona,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is in discussions with Nvidia Corp to produce its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips at the contract manufacturer's new plant in Arizona, three sources familiar with the matter said.

TSMC is already making preparations to start production early next year, the sources said.

Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which the company unveiled in March, have so far been manufactured at TSMC's facilities in Taiwan. The company has seen high demand from customers involved in generative AI and accelerated computing for the chips, which it says is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots.

The agreement, if finalised, would secure another customer for TSMC's Arizona facility, which is scheduled to start volume production next year.

TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the talks were confidential.

Two of the sources said Apple (AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are current customers at the Arizona plant. Apple and AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

However, while TSMC plans to produce the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility does not have chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) capacity that is essential to the Blackwell chips, two of the sources said.

All of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is currently in Taiwan.

Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is investing tens of billions of dollars in building three facilities in Phoenix and the project has won significant subsidies from the U.S. government which wants to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.

Eli Lilly (LLY) or Novo Nordisk (NVO)?,"Hi,

I've been researching both of these companies and would like to hear some opinions from others.

NVO seems like the better company in terms of value, but LLY appears to have a broader portfolio of products, which makes me think their competitive advantage might be stronger.

1. Do you think LLY has a stronger competitive advantage?
2. Do you believe both companies have a strong competitive advantage?

Both companies seem very similar, which makes me wonder why LLY is valued so much higher than NVO. The only reasons I can think of are that LLY is an American company and focuses on a broader range of therapeutic areas. However, these factors don’t seem enough to justify such a significantly higher valuation compared to NVO.

I currently think NVO is the better company and investment.

What are your thoughts? Is LLY's higher valuation justified? Also, do you think investing in either of these companies is a good way to diversify into the medical sector?

IOT: A Potential Dip-Buying Opportunity?,"Last night, Samsara Holdings (Ticker: IOT) reported earnings that comfortably beat both EPS and revenue expectations. Despite strong performance, the stock fell over 10% after hours. As the market said: “Cool, but your Q4 guidance is $0.8M shy of what we wanted, so here’s a **10% drop in your stock price** for your troubles.” 

  
**What Does Samsara Do?**  
Samsara provides sensors and cloud-based software to help manage vehicle fleets and industrial operations. Their Internet of Things (IoT) platform enables GPS tracking, monitors routes, assesses vehicle performance, and now includes cutting-edge AI-powered safety features.

**Earnings Highlights:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 36% YoY.
* **Large Customer Expansion:** Increased share of Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) from large customers ($100k+ ARR contracts).

**So Why the Drop?**  
Apparently, Wall Street got hung up on guidance. Samsara revised its Q4 revenue target to a midpoint of $335M, which is… drumroll… **$0.8M less than analysts expected.**

Yes, the company that just grew revenue by 36% is being punished for rounding down. This modest adjustment led to a **$3 billion market cap wipeout.** 

**Why I’m Still Buying:**

1. **Big Moves Up-Market:** Samsara is snagging bigger clients and expanding internationally, showing they’ve got staying power.
2. **Innovation FTW:** Their AI-powered **Drowsiness Detection** (launched in October) uses **38 billion minutes of video training** to spot tired drivers. Yawning? Head-nodding? Face-rubbing? Samsara knows, and they’ll tell you (and your boss). It’s next-gen safety tech that can save lives and dollars.
3. **Consistently Outperforming:** This is a company that has a habit of beating its own guidance. Personally, I’d bet they’ll do it again.

  
The way I see it, this stock drop is a classic case of Wall Street overreacting to decimal places. If you’re in it for the long haul, Samsara’s story—international expansion, innovative products, and solid execution—remains intact. I am of the opinion that represents a good buy opportunity of a stock I'm a long term fan of, would love to hear others take on the company and if i missed anything!

Intapp has an excellent growth story,"I analyzed Intapp, a company that provides “vertical” software for the financial and professional services industries, and although it is not as well known as some of the larger software companies, its stock has performed very well, especially in terms of growth, market opportunity, and financial performance since its IPO. Intapp is stock price has doubled since its IPO and is up more than 60% year-to-date, although the valuation still has a lot of upside

I note that the market for Intapp is services is huge, with a target market (TAM) of $46 billion, and the company currently has a market share of $500 million, which means it has a market share of about 1.1%. The company has demonstrated its strong growth potential by expanding its product portfolio and utilizing a low-code approach, attracting some of the top firms in the financial, legal and accounting industries as clients

Intapp is clients include well-known companies such as Lazard, Carlyle, and EY. The partnership with Microsoft, in particular, has been crucial for the company, as Intapp is software can be purchased directly from the Microsoft Azure marketplace and runs on the Azure platform. Microsoft's sales network also helps raise awareness of Intapp is products

I found that Intapp is annual recurring revenue growth rate was 27% and that the company's net revenue retention rate was 119%, which is much higher than what is common in the industry. The company has been successful in expanding its existing customer spend and further driving revenue growth through new industry expansion

In the most recent quarter, Intapp achieved rapid earnings growth, with its pro-rata operating income increasing by more than 100% and operating margin increasing by 640 basis points year-over-year

Despite Intapp is strong financials, the stock remains relatively well valued. With a current market capitalization of $5.2 billion, it is valued at a multiple of 9.0x EV/FY 2025 revenues and 7.8x EV/FY 2026 revenues based on revenue growth expectations over the next several years

Intapp is a company with strong growth potential, the demand for its products in specific industries has brought it a large number of customers and its partnership with Microsoft has further strengthened its market position. Therefore, I think the investment will be very profitable. Overall, Intapp shows very good risk-reward prospects","Intapp has an excellent growth story I analyzed Intapp, a company that provides “vertical” software for the financial and professional services industries, and although it is not as well known as some of the larger software companies, its stock has performed very well, especially in terms of growth, market opportunity, and financial performance since its IPO.

Pros and cons of this investment strategy?,"I have Roth IRA with 150k in it and like everyone I want to grow it.  I know it is a “meme” stock but I was looking at GME with this strategy.

Because it is a Roth, I don’t have any tax implications between shot term or long term.  

If I buy 5000k shares @$30 and then 
sell the 40c for 16Jan2026 for $9.50, 
I get $47.5k.  This is an immediate 
return of 31.66%.  

If I take that $47.5k and do the same - 
rinse and repeat until I can’t buy 100 shares to sell a call against.  I end up 
with 7200 Shares with my initial investment of $150k.  I also have 72 contracts at the $40 strike.  So essentially I paid 20.83 per share.  

So for my investment to lose money the price would have to drop below $20.83 
which is the risk with this strategy.  On the other side if the price stays flat at $30 and contracts expire worthless.  
My investment is now worth $216k or a 
44% return in just over a year.  If it does go up and shares are called away, then 
my account is now $288k or a 92%

Even if price drops 20% it would still be a 15% gain on original investment.

Meta Announces $10 Billion Data Center in Louisiana,"[https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-data-center-louisiana-location-2828b80a](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-data-center-louisiana-location-2828b80a)

META, the parent company of Facebook, is spending $10 billion to build its largest data center ever in Louisiana, the company confirmed on Wednesday.

The data center will take up 4 million square feet of an industrial site in the northern half of the state that once held a headlight factory.

The center will be powered by three new natural gas plants with 2.2 gigawatts of combined capacity, according to Entergy, the utility working with the tech giant. That is enough to power more than one million homes. Neal Kirby, an Entergy spokesman, said the plants will also provide power to the surrounding community.

“Entergy raised its earnings growth outlook substantially (solely because of this 1 new customer) and the stock rose 15% on that day,” wrote Rodney Rebello, an analyst covering power stocks at Reaves Asset Management, in an email to *Barron’s*. “It’s a monumental deal for the sector.”

Meta spokeswoman Stacey Yip told *Barron’s* the Louisiana data center “will be significantly larger than our other data center campuses.”

The company didn’t say how many GPUs the new facility will be able to support. Yip said estimating the future number of GPUs is becoming complex as GPU technology becomes more efficient.

Yip also said Meta will invest in 1.5 gigawatts worth of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, to reduce its carbon footprint. All told, Meta will help finance “enough clean and renewable energy to the grid to match the total electricity use of this data center,” she wrote in an email.

But it isn’t clear when those renewable projects will start. Entergy has filed for permission with the state utilities commission to build the natural gas plants, but not the renewable ones yet, Kirby said.

Meta also said on Tuesday that it is exploring using nuclear energy to power data centers, and asked companies in that field to submit proposals for nuclear reactors. Any reactors wouldn’t be available until well into the 2030s, however.

Meta is investing heavily in artificial intelligence and has been expanding the number of data centers it uses to process its AI applications. But even as the AI race accelerates, this Louisiana data center doesn’t look like it will be completed soon. The company said construction will “continue through 2030 with site work beginning in December.”

"Intel’s CEO shakeup puts foundry plans, CHIPS Act cash at risk","Intel (INTC) is in crisis. The company forced out CEO Pat Gelsinger on Monday, its stock price is down more than 50% on the year, and the grand plan to add third-party semiconductor manufacturing to its repertoire is suddenly more unclear than ever.

Gelsinger’s gambit to transform Intel into a US-based version of Taiwan’s TSMC that builds chips for its rivals is one of the reasons the company received $7.8 billion in CHIPS Act funding. But the foundry business, which it plans to operate as an independent subsidiary, has been hemorrhaging money and its biggest customer is still Intel itself.

Yes, the company has picked up deals to build chips for Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), but that hasn’t quelled calls for Intel to kill its third-party foundry plan. Bank of America Global Research analyst Vivek Arya wrote in an investor note that Intel could go as far as fully separating its design and manufacturing businesses.

But ditching its fabs, or fabrication facilities, is a lot easier said than done, especially if Intel wants to hold on to those CHIPS Act funds.

“They just got the CHIPS Acts money. And if you look very closely at the details, it basically says that Intel cannot sell more than a controlling share of the manufacturing footprint,” explained Mario Morales, group vice president of enabling technologies and semiconductors at IDC. “So that means that Intel will have to maintain manufacturing control of their capacity.”

In other words, there’s no easy path forward for the US’s largest homegrown chip builder.

The Commerce Department and Intel announced the chipmaker would be getting CHIPS Act funding just last week, with the DoC saying the cash would help Intel expand its manufacturing capacity in the US, a key part of Gelsinger’s plan to help the company compete with TSMC and Samsung, two of the largest chipmakers in the world.

Gelsinger initially unveiled the ambitious agenda, called IDM 2.0, or integrated device manufacturing 2.0, in 2021, the same year he took the reins as CEO. At the time, he said Intel would create a world-class foundry business. But Gelsinger took over an Intel beset by problems.

Lack of investment and missed opportunities over the years meant the company failed to catch the mobile wave and fell behind TSMC in design capabilities. And building out a global manufacturing footprint isn’t cheap, which, for a company that was already hurting, wasn’t ideal.

Gelsinger had four years to make the turnaround happen, and while Intel’s chip design process is catching up, building chip manufacturing facilities takes time, more than Intel’s board seemed interested in giving Gelsinger.

“Some of the problems that Intel had, and still has, are not things you can solve overnight. They are multiyear issues,” said TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell.

“Gelsinger started on a path to follow some of these things. And I think ultimately, at the highest level, what he chose to do, which is to get the manufacturing stuff back in shape and to work on design, is ultimately what the company needs to do.”

Now Intel has to make a decision: carry on with Gelsinger’s plan or cut back and focus on its own chip building capabilities or give up the business entirely. But doing that means saying goodbye to CHIPS Act money unless it can get approval from the Commerce Department

Under the terms of the CHIPS Act agreement, Intel is prohibited from certain change of control transactions. If the company spins off its foundry business, it has to hold on to at least 50.1% of the voting rights of the entity if it’s a private company. If the new entity goes public, a third party can’t own 35% or more of it. That means Intel can’t simply cut its foundry business loose and go fabless if it wants to hold on to that CHIPS money.

But moving forward with the foundry model could be difficult.

“I think as a combined entity it's hard to survive, because the biggest problem is your potential customers for foundry are all your competitors against Intel products,” explained Gartner analyst Gaurav Gupta. “So how would they have trust in Intel foundry and become its customers, right?”

If Intel does end up pulling back on its third-party manufacturing ambitions, however, it could end up eating a good portion of the losses.

“You'd have to scale back. You'd have to lay off people. I'm sure there would be some sunk cost, but the alternative is you keep losing billions of dollars a quarter,” Citi head of US semiconductor research Chris Danely told Yahoo Finance. “So, I think you just need to scrap it. Take your lumps. If you have to, return the money to the government.”

While Danely believes Intel should drop its goal of serving as a global foundry for other companies, he says it should continue to build its own chips.

“I still think they should manufacture their own CPUs,” he explained. ""There's been speculation for a long time that they're just going to turn the keys over to [TSMC] and have [TSMC] make everything. We don't think that that's the right move.”

Before that, however, Intel needs to find a new permanent CEO.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intels-ceo-shakeup-puts-foundry-plans-chips-act-cash-at-risk-194227625.html","Intel’s CEO shakeup puts foundry plans, CHIPS Act cash at risk Intel (INTC) is in crisis. The company forced out CEO Pat Gelsinger on Monday, its stock price is down more than 50% on the year, and the grand plan to add third-party semiconductor manufacturing to its repertoire is suddenly more unclear than ever. Gelsinger’s gambit to transform Intel into a US-based version of Taiwan’s TSMC that builds chips for its rivals is one of the reasons the company received $7.8 billion in CHIPS Act funding. But the foundry business, which it plans to operate as an independent subsidiary, has been hemorrhaging money and its biggest customer is still Intel itself. Yes, the company has picked up deals to build chips for Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), but that hasn’t quelled calls for Intel to kill its third-party foundry plan. Bank of America Global Research analyst Vivek Arya wrote in an investor note that Intel could go as far as fully separating its design and manufacturing businesses. But ditching its fabs, or fabrication facilities, is a lot easier said than done, especially if Intel wants to hold on to those CHIPS Act funds. “They just got the CHIPS Acts money. And if you look very closely at the details, it basically says that Intel cannot sell more than a controlling share of the manufacturing footprint,” explained Mario Morales, group vice president of enabling technologies and semiconductors at IDC. “So that means that Intel will have to maintain manufacturing control of their capacity.” In other words, there’s no easy path forward for the US’s largest homegrown chip builder. The Commerce Department and Intel announced the chipmaker would be getting CHIPS Act funding just last week, with the DoC saying the cash would help Intel expand its manufacturing capacity in the US, a key part of Gelsinger’s plan to help the company compete with TSMC and Samsung, two of the largest chipmakers in the world. Gelsinger initially unveiled the ambitious agenda, called IDM 2.0, or integrated device manufacturing 2.0, in 2021, the same year he took the reins as CEO. At the time, he said Intel would create a world-class foundry business. But Gelsinger took over an Intel beset by problems. Lack of investment and missed opportunities over the years meant the company failed to catch the mobile wave and fell behind TSMC in design capabilities. And building out a global manufacturing footprint isn’t cheap, which, for a company that was already hurting, wasn’t ideal. Gelsinger had four years to make the turnaround happen, and while Intel’s chip design process is catching up, building chip manufacturing facilities takes time, more than Intel’s board seemed interested in giving Gelsinger. “Some of the problems that Intel had, and still has, are not things you can solve overnight. They are multiyear issues,” said TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell. “Gelsinger started on a path to follow some of these things. And I think ultimately, at the highest level, what he chose to do, which is to get the manufacturing stuff back in shape and to work on design, is ultimately what the company needs to do.” Now Intel has to make a decision: carry on with Gelsinger’s plan or cut back and focus on its own chip building capabilities or give up the business entirely. But doing that means saying goodbye to CHIPS Act money unless it can get approval from the Commerce Department Under the terms of the CHIPS Act agreement, Intel is prohibited from certain change of control transactions. If the company spins off its foundry business, it has to hold on to at least 50.1% of the voting rights of the entity if it’s a private company. If the new entity goes public, a third party can’t own 35% or more of it. That means Intel can’t simply cut its foundry business loose and go fabless if it wants to hold on to that CHIPS money.

Amazon sued by DC attorney general for allegedly excluding neighborhoods from Prime delivery,"Washington, D.C.’s attorney general sued Amazon on Wednesday, accusing the company of covertly depriving residents in certain ZIP codes in the nation’s capital from access to Prime’s high-speed delivery.

The lawsuit from AG Brian Schwalb alleges that, since 2022, Amazon has “secretly excluded” two “historically underserved” D.C. ZIP codes from its expedited delivery service while charging Prime members living there the full subscription price. Amazon’s Prime membership program costs $139 a year and includes perks like two-day shipping and access to streaming content.

“Amazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide,” Schwalb said in a statement. “While Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one zip code is worth less than a dollar in another.”

In June 2022, Amazon allegedly stopped using its own delivery trucks to shuttle packages in the ZIP codes 20019 and 20020 based on concerns over driver safety, the suit states. In place of its in-house delivery network, the company relied on outside carriers like UPS and the U.S. Postal Service to make deliveries, according to the complaint, which was filed in D.C. Superior Court.

The decision caused residents in those ZIP codes to experience “significantly longer delivery times than their neighbors in other District ZIP codes, despite paying the exact same membership price for Prime,” the lawsuit says.

Data from the AG shows that before Amazon instituted the change, more than 72% of Prime packages in the two ZIP codes were delivered within two days of checkout. That number dropped to as low as 24% following the move, while two-day delivery rates across the district increased to 74%.

Amazon has faced prior complaints of disparities in its Prime program. In 2016, the company said it would expand access to same-day delivery in cities including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Washington, after a Bloomberg investigation found Black residents were “about half as likely” to be eligible for same-day delivery as white residents.

The ZIP codes in Schwalb’s complaint are in areas with large Black populations, according to 2022 Census data based on its American Community Survey.

The Federal Trade Commission also sued Amazon in June 2023, accusing the company of tricking consumers into signing up for Prime and “sabotaging” their attempts to cancel by employing so-called dark patterns, or deceptive design tactics meant to steer users toward a specific choice. Amazon said the complaint was “false on the facts and the law.” The case is set to go to trial in June 2025.

According to Scwalb’s complaint, Amazon never communicated the delivery exclusion to Prime members in the area. When consumers in the affected ZIP codes complained to Amazon about slower delivery speeds, the company said it was due to circumstances outside its control, the suit says.

The lawsuit accuses Amazon of violating the district’s consumer protection laws. It also asks the court to “put an end to Amazon’s deceptive conduct,” as well as for damages and penalties.

To get packages to customers’ doorsteps, Amazon uses a combination of its own contracted delivery companies, usually distinguishable by Amazon-branded cargo vans, as well as carriers like USPS, UPS and FedEx, and a network of gig workers who make deliveries from their own vehicles as part of its Flex program.

Amazon has rapidly expanded its in-house logistics army in recent years as it looks to speed up deliveries from two days to one day or even a few hours. In July, the company said it recorded its “fastest Prime delivery speeds ever” in the first half of the year, delivering more than 5 billion items within a day.

In relying on its own workforce, Amazon has assumed greater control over its delivery operations.

In his complaint, Schwalb cites an internal company policy that says Amazon may choose to exclude certain areas from being served by its in-house delivery network if a driver experiences “violence, intimidation or harassment.” The company relies on UPS or USPS to deliver packages in excluded areas.

Shares of American Eagle plunge 13% as company issues weak holiday guidance,"American Eagle issued weak holiday guidance on Wednesday and cut its full-year forecast as it contends with value-seeking consumers who are only willing to spend during key shopping moments. 

The apparel retailer narrowly missed Wall Street’s expectations on the top line, but beat on the bottom line. 

Here’s how American Eagle performed during its third fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 48 cents adjusted vs. 46 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $1.29 billion vs. $1.30 billion expected

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 was $80 million, or 41 cents per share, compared with $96.7 million, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges related to restructuring and impairment costs, American Eagle posted an adjusted profit of 48 cents per share. 

Sales dropped to $1.29 billion, down about 1% from $1.3 billion a year earlier. 

While it was narrow, Wednesday’s miss is the third quarter in a row that American Eagle has not met Wall Street’s sales targets.

Shares dropped about 13% in extended trading.

In a statement, CEO Jay Schottenstein touted a “strong” back-to-school shopping season but said demand remains inconsistent in between major shopping events. 

“We have entered the holiday season well positioned, with our leading brands offering high-quality merchandise, great gifts and an outstanding shopping experience across channels,” Schottenstein said. “Key selling periods have seen a positive customer response, yet we remain cognizant of potential choppiness during non-peak periods.” 

Consumers coming out for key shopping moments, and then sharply dropping off, has been a consistent theme across the retail industry. Foot Locker cited a similar dynamic when reporting earnings earlier on Wednesday, as did Dollar Tree.

For its holiday quarter, American Eagle is expecting comparable sales to be up around 1% with total sales down about 4%, including an $85 million impact from having one less selling week and a later start to the holiday shopping season. The outlook is below the 2.2% comparable sales growth StreetAccount was looking for and the 1% sales decline LSEG had expected. 

As a result, American Eagle is now expecting comparable sales to grow by 3% for the full year, down from prior guidance of 4% growth and below StreetAccount’s estimate of 4.1%. It’s now expecting full-year sales to be up 1%, down from previous guidance of between 2% and 3% and below LSEG expectations of 2.5% growth. 

Similar to other retailers, American Eagle had taken a cautious approach to the back half of the year as it contended with uncertainty around the 2024 election and the overall macroeconomic environment. But unlike its competitors, it has kept that cautious tone.

Both Abercrombie & Fitch and Dick’s Sporting Goods, which issued cautious outlooks earlier this year, reversed their previous mood when reporting earnings earlier this month. 

Despite the underwhelming outlook and sales miss, American Eagle is seeing strong demand for its Aerie brand. Third-quarter revenue for Aerie came in at an all-time high for the company and comparable sales grew 5%, on top of 12% growth from the year-ago period.

Total returns of almost 19% per year, even in a recession situation.

Can anyone give me some more info? ","Downsides of FEPI So I just found out about FEPI, and went into a rabbit hole of info on it. Did some math on it, and it seems very volatile, but at the rate of return that it promises (25-27%), it seems like a no brainer. Even if the market crashes by 50% in 2 years, then recovers back to normal in another 2 years, on an initial investment of 10k, you still come out on top. 10,000 initial investment Year 1: 2,500 DIV Yield Year 2: 1,250 DIV Yield (assuming 50% drop across all tech stocks) Year 3: 1,250 DIV Yield Year 4: 2,500 DIV Yield Total returns of almost 19% per year, even in a recession situation.

Costco's Extreme PE Ratio,"I have been a long time holder and buyer of Costco's stock, my holdings have preformed considerably well compared with the rest of my portfolio. I was buying Costco stock around 2020-2022 when the PE ratio was around 30-40. Since then the PE has shot up and is quickly approaching 60. The last time Costco had a PE this high was right before the 2000's bubble, it lost 50% of its value over the next couple years. Is Costco still worth buying at a 60 PE ratio? Is Costco doing something different with their business model in 2024 that justifies the PE to almost double from the start of 2024? Are investors starting to get irrational in this market? 

  
Sincerely, a humble investor

"GM expects more than $5 billion impact from China restructuring, including plant closures","General Motors expects a restructuring of its joint venture operations with SAIC Motor Corp. in China to cost more than $5 billion in non-cash charges and writedowns, the Detroit automaker disclosed in a federal filing Wednesday morning.

GM said it expects to write down the value of its joint-venture operations in China by between $2.6 billion and $2.9 billion. It also anticipates another $2.7 billion in charges to restructure the business, including “plant closures and portfolio optimization,” according to the filing.

GM, which previously announced plans to restructure the operations in China, did not disclose any additional details about the expected closures.

“As we have consistently said, we are focused on capital efficiency and cost discipline and have been working with SGM to turn around the business in China in order to be sustainable and profitable in the market. We are close to finalizing our restructuring plan with our partner, and we expect our results in China in 2025 to show year-over-year improvement,” GM said in an emailed statement.

GM said it believes the joint venture “has the ability to restructure without new cash investments” from the American automaker.

A majority of the restructuring costs is expected to be recognized as non-cash, special item charges during the fourth quarter. That means they will impact the automaker’s net income, but not its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes – a key metric monitored by Wall Street.

GM’s operations in China have shifted from a profit engine to liability in the past decade as competition grows from government-backed domestic automakers fueled by nationalism, and as a generational shift in consumer perceptions of the automotive industry and electric vehicles takes hold.

Equity income from GM’s Chinese operations and joint ventures peaked at more than $2 billion in 2014 and 2015.

GM’s market share in China, including its joint ventures, has plummeted from roughly 15% as recently as 2015 to 8.6% last year — the first time it has dropped below 9% since 2003. GM’s equity income from the operations have also fallen, down 78.5% since peaking in 2014, according to regulatory filings.

GM’s U.S.-based brands such as Buick and Chevrolet have seen sales drop more than its joint venture sales with SAIC Motor, Wuling Motors and others. The joint venture models accounted for about 60% of its 2.1 million vehicles sold last year in China.

Prior to this year, the only quarterly losses for GM in China since 2009 were a $167 million shortfall during the first quarter of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic and an $87 million loss during the second quarter of 2022.

The Detroit automaker has reported three consecutive quarterly losses in equity income for its Chinese operations this year, totaling $347 million. That includes a loss of $137 million during the third quarter.

Would having the ETF be a safer play then just investing in a stock such as coin? Or does it not really matter at the end of the day?

Im looking to make this around 10-20% of my portfolio. Do you think this is an ok decision or should i just stick with the funds I have? Any opinions would be appreciated.

Rivians everywhere I look! ,"I know this is anecdotal, and not a good reason to invest, but I have been seeing Rivians everywhere lately. I decided to do a little digging. 

Rivian's sales were up 71% compared to Q1 2023. The company has been ramping up production, although it has faced some challenges due to supply chain issues. Rivian has adjusted its delivery targets for 2024 to between 50,500 and 52,000 vehicles.

I understand that they have been struggling to make a profit, which definitely cannot be overlooked. But, there is no denying that the demand is there. The backing is also there. Volkswagen has invested in Rivian. In 2024, Volkswagen announced an investment of up to $5 billion in Rivian, with the goal of developing next-generation electric vehicle architecture and software technology. The two companies formed a joint venture to collaborate on this project.

The stock has been sitting in the 10-15 dollar range the last 6 months. It seems to me that the market is waiting for it to break one way or another. If it breaks to the upside I could see a lot of people that have been waiting on the sidelines hop on board. 

This is just my quick two cents on the stock. Would love to hear everyone’s else’s opinion. I decided to throw 100 dollars on it as a fun bet. I’m definitely routing for them. I think their trucks looks really cool, and I love the new cars in the pipeline. 

I’m sure this post will get marked as low effort, but I don’t want to have my post be 5 pages of AI, like every other post.

ESPN hopes to reach more casual sports fans with Disney+ integration,"ESPN is coming to Disney+. Now, the sports network wants to make sure Disney+ users come to ESPN.

Walt Disney debuted a dedicated ESPN tile Wednesday on Disney+ for people who subscribe to ESPN+, its sports streaming platform, to watch programming without leaving the Disney+ application. Next fall, when ESPN launches its yet-to-be-named “flagship” service, those subscribers will get full access to all ESPN content through the ESPN tile on Disney+.

Disney is making about 100 live games available to Disney+ members without a corresponding ESPN subscription. Those events will span college football and basketball, the National Basketball Association and WNBA, the National Hockey League, Major League Baseball, tennis, golf, the Little League World Series, and UFC, ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said in an interview.

Next week’s alternate “Simpsons” telecast of the NFL’s “Monday Night Football” game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Dallas Cowboys will also be available to Disney+ subscribers, as well as five NBA Christmas games.

“Now when you subscribe to Disney+, you’ll have access to kids and family, general entertainment if you’re a Hulu subscriber, and sports,” said Pitaro. “Our goal is to serve sports fans anytime, anywhere.”

ESPN will also include some of its studio programming — such as “College Gameday,” “Pardon the Interruption” and certain podcasts that include video — on Disney+ for non-ESPN subscribers. Some ESPN sports-related films and documentaries will also appear on Disney+ married to whatever sports season is active, Pitaro said.

ESPN’s programming will also be integrated within the Disney+ search, similar to Hulu’s integration earlier this year. If a Disney+ subscriber who isn’t an ESPN customer clicks on something that requires an ESPN subscription, the user will be prompted to sign up within the app.

# New content for Disney+

ESPN is also creating two studio shows specifically for Disney+, Pitaro said. The first will be a daily “SportsCenter” just for Disney+ subscribers, which will air live on Disney+ at a set time and then remain on the platform for on-demand viewing.

The second is a women’s sports show that may air weekly or several times a week. Both programs are in development and will be made for a more casual sports fan, said Pitaro.

“Our research shows there’s very little overlap between people watching Disney+ and ESPN linear,” said Pitaro.

Disney+ has a strong female audience that Pitaro hopes will tune into the weekly’s women’s show, which he first alluded to in an interview with CNBC Sport in October.

ESPN+ has about 30,000 live games each year and costs $11.99 per month when purchased separately from Disney+. A Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ bundle (with ads) costs $16.99 per month.

Name a large-cap stock and its small-cap competitor ,"I am always looking for small/mid-cap companies that have a similar business model or product as large cap competitors!

These smaller cap stocks are obviously a bigger risk, since a lot of them still are not making money, but the growth is very appealing.

•	SCHG vs. SPLG: High overlap (~30%-40%) due to shared large-cap growth names like Apple and Microsoft. SPLG is broader but tech-heavy.
	
•	SCHG vs. SCHD: Minimal overlap. SCHG is growth-focused, while SCHD avoids most tech in favor of dividend payers like Pepsi and Coke.
	
•	SPLG vs. SCHD: Moderate overlap; both hold large-cap dividend stocks but differ in sector balance.

Is Nebius / Yandex a pump and dump or is it going to recover up to prewar prices?,"Nebius (NASDAQ:NBIS) shares surged more than 8% on Tuesday as investment firm Citron Research pounded the table on the artificial intelligence-focused technology firm and said CEO Arkady Volozh is ""the real deal.""

""Citron pounding the table that $NBIS is poised to be the next AI Wall Street darling,"" the research firm wrote on the X social network. ""A sleeper with no analyst coverage yet, the market hasn’t caught on to its massive potential—or its undervaluation vs. CoreWeave."" Shares have gained nearly 35% over the past month.

Nebius, which was once known as Yandex before it severed ties with the Russian firm, was likened to cloud service provider Coreweave by Citron, which is likely to go public next year.

""If it trades at a 50% discount to Coreweave multiple that puts $NBIS at $60 (napkin math),"" Citron added, explaining that Nvidia's (NVDA) investment into Nebius was ""not out of the blue.""

On Monday, Nvidia was among the backers in a $700M private placement financing round by Nebius. Other investors include Accel and certain accounts managed by Orbis Investments. The financing will help Nebius' plans to further build out its full-stack AI infrastructure.","Is Nebius / Yandex a pump and dump or is it going to recover up to prewar prices?

Tesla CEO Elon Musk loses bid to get $56 billion pay package reinstated,"A Delaware judge ruled on Monday that Tesla, CEO Elon Musk still is not entitled to receive a $56 billion compensation package despite shareholders of the electric vehicle company voting to reinstate it.The ruling by the judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery, follows her January decision that called the pay package excessive and rescinded it, surprising investors, and cast uncertainty over Musk's future at the world's most valuable carmaker.

Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for Musk, the company's driving force who is responsible for many of its advances, and reinstate his compensation.McCormick also ordered Tesla to pay the attorneys who brought the case $345 million, well short of the billions they initially requested.

Protecting Gains on 300 META Shares Without Selling: Selling Deep ITM Calls Strategy,"
I currently hold 300 shares of META that I purchased back in March and have seen decent gains. I want to protect these profits without triggering taxes from selling before the one-year mark (to qualify for long-term capital gains).

I’m considering selling deep in-the-money (ITM) calls with March expiration. These options would expire shortly after my one-year holding period, so my shares would be eligible for long-term capital gains if exercised after expiration.

I understand that selling deep ITM calls could constrain my margin account while the options are open. Aside from that, are there any other risks or pitfalls I should be aware of with this strategy? For example:
	•	Could this strategy be flagged as a “constructive sale” by the IRS?
	•	What happens if the calls are exercised before the March expiration?
	•	Are there better alternatives to hedge while preserving my tax situation?

"Salesforce shares rise after earnings beat on revenue, fourth-quarter guidance","Salesforce shares were up 8% on Tuesday after the company reported its fiscal third-quarter earnings, reporting revenue and fiscal fourth-quarter guidance that exceeded analysts’ expectations.

Here is how the company did compared to what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** $2.41 adjusted vs. $2.44 expected
* **Revenue:** $9.44 billion vs. $9.34 billion expected

The company’s revenue grew 8% year-over-year during the fiscal third quarter, which ended on Oct. 31. Its net income was $1.5 billion in the quarter, up 25% from $1.2 billion a year ago.

Salesforce said that it is expecting fiscal fourth-quarter sales to come in between $9.90 billion to $10.10 billion. Analysts were projecting $10.05 billion in fourth-quarter sales.

The company said that it expects an earnings per share between the range of $2.57 and $2.62 in the fourth-quarter, compared to analysts’ expectations of $2.65.

Salesforce also raised the low end of its revenue guidance for its fiscal 2025 to come between $37.8 billion and $38 billion. That’s up slightly from $37.7 billion to $38 billion previously. The new range puts the mid point for Salesforce’s fiscal 2025 revenue guidance at $37.9 billion, ahead of analysts’ expectations of $37.86 billion.

“We delivered another quarter of exceptional financial performance across revenue, margin, cash flow, and cRPO,” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a statement. “Agentforce, our complete AI system for enterprises built into the Salesforce Platform, is at the heart of a groundbreaking transformation.”

The company in August announced that CFO Amy Weaver would step down from her role as chief financial officer but remain in the position until the company appoints a successor, after which she will become an advisor. That same month, activist investor Starboard Value revealed that it boosted its position in Salesforce by roughly 40% in the second quarter following the firm issuing a letter earlier in the year saying that Salesforce was continuing to move “in the right direction” in regards to improving its profit margin.

Starboard Value released a presentation in October in which it noted that Salesforce “can continue to become more efficient and more profitable.”

These authorizations cover the entirety of Palantir’s product offerings and programs—including AIP, Apollo, Foundry, Gotham, FedStart, and Mission Manager—and therefore enable Palantir to provide any of its product offerings to the U.S. Government at the FedRAMP High baseline.

United Health situation,"One thing I see repeated across reddit is that business are evil and stealing all the money.
 I have seen many people happy the United Health CEO got assassinated. I also frequently see people complain about walmart and other corporations. Now I don't care too much this happens, but I wanted to know if I'm missing something.

The margin for United health is 5%. Most insurance companies have a similar margin. Retailers like Walmart have a margin of 3%.

This publicly verifiable information seems to contradict the prevailing narrative of corporations price gouging does it not?
If United make a profit of $5 for every 100 in premiums it receives, then even if they were a non profit and passed all savings to consumers the price of health care insurance would only go down 5%. In the case of walmart your $100 grocery bill would go down to $97.

I Want to Hear Your Thoughts on the Qualities Intel’s Next CEO Should Have and Why,"With Pat Gelsinger retiring, the company is once again searching for a CEO who can steer it through its challenges.

Who do you think Intel needs next as CEO, and why? Should it be an insider with deep technical expertise or someone from outside with a fresh perspective? How do you think the leadership transition will unfold in the coming months/years?

Here’s a quick summary of Intel’s past CEOs, their departures, and the criticisms they faced, for reference:  


|**CEO**|**Predecessor's Reason for Departure**|**Public Criticism or Perceived Failures**|**Successor’s Key Attributes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Pat Gelsinger**|Bob Swan replaced due to lack of technical background|Struggled to regain process leadership; delays in 7nm; stiff competition from AMD and TSMC|Deep technical expertise, Intel veteran, proven leader at VMware|
|**Bob Swan**|Brian Krzanich resigned after a policy violation|Failed to address manufacturing delays; lacked vision to compete with AMD/ARM-based chips|Stability-focused leader with strong financial acumen|

Super Micro Computer pops 15% after special committee finds no ‘evidence of misconduct’,"Super Micro Computer surged more than 14% after a special committee ruled that it found “no evidence of misconduct” at the embattled AI server maker, and appointed a new chief accounting officer.

“The evidence reviewed by the Special Committee did not raise any substantial concerns about the integrity of Supermicro’s senior management or Audit Committee, or their commitment to ensuring that the Company’s financial statements are materially accurate,” the company said in a release.

Super Micro said it’s also currently searching for a new chief financial officer, and looking to fill additional financial leadership positions. The company appointed current Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller Kenneth Cheung as its chief accounting officer.

The news from Super Micro Computer comes on the heels of a volatile year for the company. Shares sank in August after Hindenburg Research revealed a short position in the company, saying that it found “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation” and the company delayed the release of its annual filing.

Those troubles continued, with Ernst & Young resigning as the company’s auditor in October due to concerns about the board’s governance and independence. Shares are up about 30% this year, after giving back much of its rally. Last month, the company averted a potential delisting from the Nasdaq following its monster plunge.

Among the findings, the committee ruled that the conclusions reached by Ernst & Young in its resignation were “not supported by the facts” and that the firm’s audit committee exhibited “appropriate independence and generally provided proper oversight.”

The special committee consisted of Super Micro’s board, counsel from Cooley LLP and a team from forensic accounting firm Secretariat Advisors.

"""Existencial question"" about common stocks.","Let's suppose that a few financial analysts have evaluated the intrinsic value of the shares of company X. By ""intrinsic"", I mean not only the value of the company underlying assets (tangible and intangible) minus liabilities but also any other type of fundamental analysis. By consensus, the intrinsic value was estimated at $1 per share.

However, the market value is $0.70. In other words, the stock is being sold at a discount. Is there any kind of arbitrage that forces the market price to converge towards the intrinsic value? I haven't yet found any reason that would encourage the increase in the market price beyond the usual speculation. Even if the stock has an intrinsic value of $1, shareholders cannot liquidate it outside the secondary market...

Arbitrage in derivatives markets is easier to understand. Suppose the market price of gold is M. To secure this price in the future, an investor can buy a gold call option at a price P (strike price), where M = P on the date of purchase of the option. After some time, the market price of gold is M+N. Consequently, the option has gained a value of N, that is: it can be sold directly for N to another investor. Even if there is no liquidity in the derivatives market to sell the option for N, the investor can exercise the right to buy gold for P and sell the gold in the spot market for M+N. From this exercise, he would obtain the same N.

In the equity market, I don't see a similar way for an investor to liquidate the intrinsic value of the stock. It doesn't make much sense either. So, there's only speculation left. If that's really the case, it's quite problematic. As a famous economist said: ""Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.""","""Existencial question"" about common stocks.

GM to sell stake in battery cell plant to joint venture partner for roughly $1 billion,"General Motors plans to sell its stake in a $2.6 billion electric vehicle battery cell plant in Michigan to its joint venture partner LG Energy Solution, the automaker announced Monday.

The Detroit carmaker said it expects to recoup its investment in the facility, which a source familiar with the plans said is anticipated to be roughly $1 billion. The sale is part of a non-binding agreement between the two companies that’s anticipated to close during the first quarter of next year, GM said.

The nearly completed, 2.8 million-square-foot plant in Lansing, Michigan, was expected to be the third battery cell facility of the joint venture, known as Ultium Cells LLC, following plants in Ohio and Tennessee that have already opened and are operational.

The Lansing plant was announced in January 2022, and the two companies first announced their joint venture five years ago.

GM’s move comes as the automaker attempts to right-size production of electric vehicles and confronts slower-than-expected consumer demand. It also comes amid uncertainty regarding federal incentives for manufacturing and purchasing EVs in the U.S. under President-elect Donald Trump.

The automaker said the sale does not impact its overall ownership stake in the joint venture or its future plans for a separate joint venture plant with LGES rival Samsung SDI.

“We believe we have the right cell and manufacturing capabilities in place to grow with the EV market in a capital efficient manner,” GM CFO Paul Jacobson said in a release. “When completed, this transaction will also help LG Energy Solution meet demand by leveraging capacity that’s nearly ready to come online and it will make GM even more efficient.” 

GM said the South Korean battery supplier will have immediate access to the Lansing facility to begin installation of equipment. The plant, which currently employs nearly 100 people, was expected to begin operating by the end of this year.

Separate from the sale of its stake in the Lansing facility, GM on Monday announced it will extend a 14-year battery technology partnership with LGES to include the development of an emerging type of battery cell called prismatic cells.

Prismatic cells are a flat, rectangular shape with a rigid enclosure, which allows for space-efficient packaging within battery modules and packs. GM said the cells are expected to reduce EV weights and costs, while simplifying manufacturing by reducing the number of modules and mechanical components.

“We’re focused on optimizing our battery technology by developing the right battery chemistries and form factors to improve EV performance, enhance safety, and reduce costs. By extending our partnership with LG Energy Solution, we’re taking an important step towards these goals,” Kurt Kelty, GM vice president of battery cell and pack, said in a release.

GM had previously said it planned to expand its battery cell technologies from its flat “Ultium” pouches to include other forms such as prismatic cells.

The only info they would give is that my grandmothers account or stocks are “inactive”.

If what i found on google is correct , it sounds like the stocks were escheated, but we don’t know the next step from there. She lived in CT and FL, then back to CT after she got sick.

Costco tariffs coming to a store near you! ,"I love Costco, the stores are awesome and they have everything but i feel the stock has gotten out of control.

The PE is 59! you are paying $59 for every $1 they earn. Thats just irresponsible investing.

They are expanding across Asia but they are also facing stiff competition from home base Chinese companies. And one thing china is very good at: copying everyone else and selling stuff for cheap to eliminate competition. Im not saying Costco will fail but it wont be easy for them outside the US.

Lastly we have the tariff situation. The proposition is a 10% tariff on Chinese goods and a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. This is a bit of a problem because Costco is the #12 importer in the US for 2024. Most common origin is China. Walmart got smart and started to protect themselves and reducing Chinese imports but Costco and their business model, will have a much harder time navigating with keeping the prices attractive.

Costco sells ALOT of electronics and appliances, its one of their biggest categories. If a TV cost $1000 today, staring Jan 20th(day one in office) it will cost $1600. Appliances going up $100's of dollars is hyper inflation and people are already stretched thin going into the holidays.

Im really looking forward to this upcoming earnings release and how they will guide going forward. I guarantee you all the analyst questions will be about tariffs and profit margins.

Costco's profit margin for fiscal 2023 was 2.6%. Costco's profit margin for 2024 was 2.9%. They can only raise the membership and prices so much before people starting shopping elsewhere.

"These are the stocks on my watchlist (12/2)
","Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader.

This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold some/all MAG 7 stocks and market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts.

I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved.

PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don’t ask about earnings because I typically don’t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?” or “Why isn’t \_\_\_ on the watchlist?” or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion.

Anyone else buying the NU dip?,"I’ve been an investor in NU for a while now. I firmly believe the market is panic selling because Warren Buffet sold 19% of his stake in the company.

Today the company is down again because Citi bank downgraded its rating on NU to a sell.

Why do people care that Citi bank downgraded to a sell? It’s literally a bank that could potentially have to rival NU soon if they break into USA markets. Citi bank is just worried about a rapidly growing, amazing company.

If anything, the downgrade should be seen as a good sign. It shows that american banks like Citi are starting to feel a bit of pressure from how fast NU has been able to expand its user base.

I know Brazil has made changes to its financial regulations. However, NU is rapidly expanding its user base to other countries. Plus, Brazils projected annual GDP growth per year is very good.

Do you guys agree?

EDIT:

(Thanks for all your thoughts. I’ve realized there are a few key things I overlooked.

I previously thought the stock was heavily owned by retail investors, similar to SoFi’s stock. I naively assumed this because the stock is frequently discussed on social media. Due to this preconceived notion, I believed the stock price would be significantly influenced by analyst ratings. I still think a large number of people have started to sell because of Warren Buffett reducing his stake and Citi’s sell recommendation. However, I now see that the primary factors driving this downturn are geopolitical and economic risks in Brazil.

My updated assessment is that the stock is being sold for a few very valid reasons. Firstly, Brazil’s inflation has been rising over the past few quarters. Secondly, Donald Trump has threatened BRICS nations with 100% tariffs if they decide to create a currency to rival the U.S. dollar. Thirdly, Warren Buffett sold 19% of his stake in the company. Fourthly, the value of Brazil’s currency has been declining and recently hit historic lows compared to the U.S. dollar. Finally, Brazil’s government spending was recently cut, potentially signaling a slowdown in their economy.

Overall, people are very concerned about the economic and geopolitical risks surrounding NU, especially since it is a Brazilian company. Brazil has a historically unstable economy and is currently facing economic headwinds that are amplified by the risk of potential tariffs.

I’m taking a cautious approach from here on out. I won’t be selling any shares, but I also won’t be buying more until the stock price consolidates and the Brazilian economy stabilizes.

I’m still very bullish on NU because the company has grown unbelievably fast in just 11 years. They survived Brazil’s economic collapse in 2014–2016, and they also weathered the last round of U.S. tariffs on Brazil in 2018. I believe NU will continue to expand rapidly into other Latin American countries, which will reduce its exposure to Brazilian tariffs and economic challenges. The CEO and management team are extremely competent, and I believe in their ability to navigate these challenges in the long term.

The worst-case scenario would be if the BRICS nations successfully create a new currency. Even then, I still believe NU will be okay due to its expansion into other markets. For now, I’m holding and remain very bullish on the business.)","Anyone else buying the NU dip? I’ve been an investor in NU for a while now.

Is anyone else a little concerned about this market jump up?,"Listen, I get that it seems like clear skies and rainbows, and I’m not really a “bearish” type investor, but sometimes I find it good practice to sit back for a moment and just reevaluate the current situation we’re in.

I’ll give an example that pertains to me. I’m currently invested in Sofi, PLTR, and RKLB, so this has been an incredible year for me. But looking back, it’s starting to really feel like total and utter exuberance again like 2021. YouTube videos and subreddits have been saying over and over how this is only the beginning and we’re going to be at 500 next year. That’s exactly the type of shit that was said in 2021 right before every small cap stock tanked like 70%. 

I’m not saying it’s a time to sell, I would personally prescribe to the “it’s time to slow down on how much I invest” currently. Buying RKlb at 27$ or PLTR at 66$ is not the same opportunity as in the 4-7$ range as it used to be. It seems very difficult to find any good deals, considering literally almost every sector in the stock market is just going up vertically. And just remember, just it is a great company doesn’t always mean it’s currently a good price to buy it. Sometimes it’s good to take the foot off the breaks when stocks going up 300%+ in one year.

But hey what do I know. Just be careful out there folks, and don’t get sucked too hard into the FOMO. Be fearful when everyone else is greedy and all that jazz.","Is anyone else a little concerned about this market jump up?

I predict Apple will acquire Nissan in the next 18 months,"The Japanese automaker is facing severe financial challenges and may run out of cash within 12 months, putting it on the brink of bankruptcy.

Apple, with its bold ambitions to enter the electric vehicle (EV) market, has already invested over $10 billion in R&D for the Apple Car. Despite canceling the project earlier this year, that investment exceeds Nissan's current valuation.

Partnering with Nissan could help Apple overcome the manufacturing hurdles it faced with its EV project. Nissan has proven expertise, having produced the Nissan Leaf, the best-selling non-Tesla EV of all time.

The global EV market is one of the fastest-growing industries, projected to double by 2030. By acquiring Nissan, Apple could transform its vehicles into sleek, cutting-edge products that seamlessly integrate into the Apple ecosystem.

This move would allow Apple to directly challenge Tesla, reinforcing its position as the world’s most valuable company, ahead of competitors like NVIDIA and Microsoft.","I predict Apple will acquire Nissan in the next 18 months The Japanese automaker is facing severe financial challenges and may run out of cash within 12 months, putting it on the brink of bankruptcy.

Does AVGO is rise count as a gift?,"Since October 2024, Broadcom has underperformed many of its technology peers as investors have rebalanced their allocations to the semiconductor sector.

Despite the recent relative weakness, Broadcom has remained in line with the S&P 500, demonstrating stability.

Broadcom expects AI revenue to reach $12 billion in fiscal 2024, accounting for less than 25% of total revenue.

Custom AI chips are at the core of Broadcom is AI revenues, accounting for up to two-thirds of the total, driven primarily through partnerships with hyperscalers such as Microsoft, AWS, and Google.

Customized chips are expected to play a more important role over the next five years, helping customers address AI cluster scaling and cost challenges.

Broadcom is leadership in the networking market could be challenged by NVIDIA, which is capturing the market with more competitive networking solutions.

Broadcom is growth in AI, while promising, is still a low percentage of overall revenue from AI.

Weakness in the non-AI revenue segment could undermine the market's bullish confidence in Broadcom.

Wall Street is constructive on Broadcom, but future guidance needs to remain strong to maintain market confidence.

Broadcom is forward-looking PEG ratio of 1.69 is attractive compared to the tech sector average of 1.89.

I think attention needs to be paid to the company's execution in AI and potential headwinds in non-AI businesses.

On balance, Broadcom stock is under short-term pressure, but the long-term bullish logic remains in place for investors who are optimistic about AI growth prospects.

What do we think about IOVA?,"Firstly congrats everyone on RKLB, ACHR and LUNR gains. It was fun ride, I have to be honest I had jumped off the wagon a bit earlier but hat off to all of you that mooned! 

Also for some of you that jumped on ZETA, enjoy the good days that await. 

But let’s talk about IOVA…:

Another biopharma stock trying to solve the issues of cancer. An industry that is a Holy Grail for all pump and dumpers out here. 

But is this one different? To be honest I do not know, but that is why I am posting this. To hear other sides, other points of view. 

IOVA is currently sitting around $9. These are levels of before the this year run to $16 (what goes up must come down, when pumped and dumped). However… this company reported revenues, 90.86mil revenue to be precise. Granted, not enough to support current market cap but bear in mind it is bio industry we talk about. It takes 1 approval and it is too late.

Leadership:
CEO is there since 2016, seems like an experienced guy. Was contributor to many oncology drugs already developed and approved.

Others seem legit as well, this post is already too long… feel free to research yourself.

They also own a bit less than 12% so there is certain commitment there.  And of course the vanguard, black rock etc. are heavily involved as well. More than 87% is owned by institutions. 

Amtagvi product got approved by FDA and that is now generating certain revenue. They plan tk get approval in Canada, Europe and UK as well. 

They also work on LN-145, IOV-4001 and IOV-3001 but let’s be honest these are long shots and nothing guarantee success of these.

I know these are speculations and putting some numbers from the future is no way to go but I feel like I have to just to make this post a bit more complete.

Potential yearly revenue if approved broader and if nothing goes wrong  is 12billion (amount of people with cancer of specific type * cost of treatment) but realistic values at beginning is 1-2bill per year or even less. 

And then for all the gamblers time that with moon if other drugs get approved as well. 

Company with 90mil revenue and 80 million of debt with 2,8 billion market cap and 440 million of operating expenses. Company with future (on the moon or in the sand). Do you hate IOVA or you will become a bag holder? 

Please share your opinions.","What do we think about IOVA? Firstly congrats everyone on RKLB, ACHR and LUNR gains.
